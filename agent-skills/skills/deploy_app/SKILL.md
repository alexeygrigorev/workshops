# Deploy App Skill

## What I do

I help deploy the application using the deployment pipeline.

## Deployment Steps

1. Check deployment status: @scripts/status.sh
2. Run deployment: @scripts/deploy.sh
3. Verify with template: @templates/verification.md

## Quick Deploy

For quick deployment, use:
```
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```
