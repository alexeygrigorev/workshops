# Counter Skill

## What I do

I help count items, list things with numbers, or provide numbered lists.

## How to use

When the user asks to:
- Count items in a list
- Number the items
- Create a numbered list

Always format the output as a clear numbered list like:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
