# Coding Standards Skill

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

You have loaded this skill because the user is asking about coding standards, function templates, or code validation.

## IMPORTANT - Actions You Must Take

1. Use the read_file tool to read: skills/coding_standards/templates/function_template.md
   - This contains the REQUIRED function template pattern
   - DO NOT answer questions about function structure without reading this file first

2. When asked to check if code follows standards, use the bash_command tool to run:
   skills/coding_standards/scripts/check_standards.sh

The complete standards and templates are in those files. This skill is just a pointer to those resources.
