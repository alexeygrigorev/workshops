Preparing for a Data Science Interview

0:00 Hi everyone, welcome to our event. This
0:02 event is brought to you by data talks
0:03 which is a community of people who love
0:05 data. We have weekly events. Today is
0:07 one of the one of such events. I think
0:10 this is already second this year. So
0:13 yeah, welcome. If you want if you want
0:15 to find out more about more about the
0:18 events we have, there is a link in the
0:20 description. Go there uh click on this
0:22 link and you'll see all the events we
0:23 have in our pipeline. And by the way,
0:25 the screenshot is so updated uh outdated
0:28 because I think YouTube changed the
0:31 interface recently. But doesn't matter.
0:33 The important part is don't forget to
0:35 subscribe to our YouTube channel if you
0:37 want to get notified about uh interviews
0:40 and uh webinars like um cool videos like
0:44 we have today. And then we have an
0:46 amazing Slack community which you need
0:48 to join if you don't want to miss out.
0:50 um you'll be able to talk to a lot of
0:54 data enthusiasts. So during today's
0:56 interview, you can ask any question you
0:58 want. There is a link in description.
0:59 Click on that link, ask your question
1:01 and I will be covering the questions
1:03 during the interview.
1:05 And um yeah, I forgot most of the words
1:09 I usually say during the intro. So I had
1:11 to improvise a little bit. But now I
1:13 will open the questions we prepared for
1:16 you.
1:17 Do you know man, I've only literally
1:19 just seen those questions because they
1:21 were they were in the in they were in
1:23 the invite, right? And uh yeah, I didn't
1:26 catch them until literally 10 minutes.
1:27 Did you Did we not send you the actual
1:30 file?
1:32 Don't think so. But it's okay. I'll
1:33 flick through and they're all fine. So,
1:34 it's all good.
1:35 Yeah, we can improvise. Anyways, there
1:38 will be questions from the audience
1:40 which are not in the file anyways.
1:43 Okay. So, it means you're ready, right?
1:47 I'm ready, man. Born ready.
1:51 This week, we'll talk about preparing
1:53 for a technical data science interview.
1:55 We have a special guest today, Luke.
1:57 Luke is a co-founder of Neural AI, a
1:59 company that specializes in recruiting
2:01 data scientists and other AI
2:03 professionals. He has over 10 years of
2:05 experience working as a recruiter. And
2:09 what is more, Luke is also a podcast
2:12 podcast host. So, he's hosting the AI
2:16 game changer podcast. Pleasure to have
2:18 you.
2:20 Pleasure to be here, man. For the second
2:21 time. I feel like you and I, we just do
2:25 podcast episodes with each other now. We
2:27 really need to get other guests, I
2:28 think.
2:29 Exactly. Yeah, I was going to mention
2:31 that Luke is actually second time today.
2:34 So, Luke is one of our very first
2:36 guests. I think you were like third or
2:38 fourth, I don't remember. like but uh it
2:41 was last time I interviewed you you it
2:45 was two years ago when data talks club
2:48 podcast just started it's been a while
2:50 and yeah before we actually start I want
2:52 to mention that the questions for
2:54 today's interview are prepared by
2:56 Johanna so thanks Johanna for your help
2:59 and let's start so look tell us what's
3:03 up what you've been up to since uh we
3:06 spoke last time
3:07 yeah um and yeah maybe also tell just a
3:10 few words about yourself before that.
3:12 Yeah. So, um maybe I can give you and
3:14 the listeners a bit of background about
3:16 me. So, um as you quite rightly
3:19 mentioned, I've been in recruitment for
3:20 uh well over a decade now. So, um I've
3:23 got the gray hairs and the crow's eyes
3:25 fe
3:28 um but historically I used to help
3:29 companies find um data professionals but
3:32 more from kind of like a traditional BI
3:35 descriptive analyticsy kind of focus. Um
3:39 but over the past 10 years that's kind
3:41 of transitioned and I've kind of worked
3:42 with the market. So over the past maybe
3:46 six years now I would say that I've had
3:48 three key focuses. So number one um
3:52 machine learning or deep learning at the
3:54 core of all of the engineering hires
3:56 I've made. Um and obviously that would
3:58 encapsulate all of the other bits around
3:59 that. So traditional data science or
4:01 data engineering and everything else in
4:04 between. Um,
4:06 I've worked pretty much exclusively uh
4:08 exclusively with early to mid-stage
4:11 startups. Um, so I don't do much in the
4:14 corporate space anymore. Um, as I say, I
4:16 tend to work with smaller organizations
4:18 that really need me. Um, and then
4:22 lastly,
4:23 I do most of my work in Germany. I'd say
4:25 that 90% of my work is in Germany. Um,
4:29 but since the pandemic, I've kind of
4:31 broadened out to kind of central Europe
4:33 as a whole. But I' I've still got my
4:35 kind of core client base in uh in
4:37 Germany. So yeah, that's me. Um but we
4:40 found
4:41 based in Germany, right?
4:42 No, I'm in Kent, if anyone knows where
4:45 that is, it's a really beautiful part of
4:47 the UK. So uh yeah, I don't know if you
4:50 can see actually, but the background
4:51 I've just had the office uh renovated
4:53 and stuff. So uh yeah, really happy
4:56 about that.
4:58 I'm just curious, how does it happen
4:59 that recruiters from the UK work in
5:02 Germany?
5:05 This is a bit of a long story.
5:08 I'll try and
5:08 I'm not the only recruiter from the UK
5:11 who works in Germany. Like it's quite a
5:13 trend. I don't know actually many
5:14 Germans.
5:16 Yeah. Um, so the story is I'll try and
5:19 condense this as much as I can. So uh I
5:21 can't remember when it was but I don't
5:23 know what year it was but long story
5:25 short I was moving to Australia and in
5:27 the time I joined a company in Australia
5:29 and in the time period of me waiting for
5:31 my visas to come they look why don't you
5:33 join us and work with our German
5:35 business and help us do some business
5:37 development and win some clients and do
5:39 some recruitment in Germany and kind of
5:40 the interim of you moving over to
5:42 Australia.
5:44 In that interim period, I met Rachel,
5:46 who's my co-founder, girlfriend
5:49 and life partner. Um, and uh, yeah, as I
5:53 say, it got to a stage where I was like,
5:55 well, I'm kind of moving to Australia
5:57 and blah blah blah blah. So, uh, yeah,
6:00 long story short, it kind of worked out
6:01 that actually I just stayed in the UK
6:02 and I really enjoyed working with German
6:04 clients and German people in general.
6:06 So, um, so yeah, it just continued from
6:09 there. That was a very condensed
6:10 version, but yeah, serendipitous, I
6:13 guess. But um yeah, it was cool, man.
6:16 Okay. Um do you remember what bespoke
6:19 two years ago?
6:22 Standing out as a data scientist was the
6:23 topic, right? But
6:25 that was a topic. Yeah.
6:26 Yeah. The specifics, man, you're going
6:28 to have to remind me.
6:30 I don't remember. But uh yeah, what you
6:33 were up to this years, what changed?
6:37 Um, apart from
6:40 Yeah, I mean, um, to be honest with like
6:42 not much has changed since we last spoke
6:44 in terms of what I do on a dayto-day.
6:46 Um, I think now as a individual and a
6:50 business, I feel a lot more like
6:51 embedded into the community. Like
6:52 obviously I've been running the podcast.
6:54 Um, I release a lot of content on a
6:57 weekly basis and I feel like I'm much
6:59 more well known in the industry now than
7:01 what I was three, four, five years ago.
7:04 Um, I think that's largely due to
7:07 now that I work for myself,
7:10 well, yeah, like that that's kind of a
7:12 big part of it as well, but I think
7:14 largely when I used to work for other
7:16 organizations that were um a lot more
7:19 corporate and and bigger, um, I had to
7:22 kind of be a recruiter for that
7:24 business. But now I feel like I can be
7:27 exactly who I am and all of my content
7:30 and what I do and how I work with
7:31 customers and people. um it reflects
7:34 that. So um yeah, I feel like I'm just
7:37 much more like much more well known in
7:40 the industry now than what I was when we
7:42 we first spoke. Um but yeah, as I say, I
7:44 think that's largely due to just being
7:46 able to be myself and do what I do. Um
7:50 without having ultra amounts of pressure
7:52 from directors and the organization to
7:55 make placements at all cost. Um, so
7:59 yeah, but I mean on a day-to-day basis,
8:00 man, I do recruitment and I work with my
8:02 customers and we make placements and
8:03 it's all really good fun. But, um, yeah,
8:06 as I say, it's been fun. I mean, did we
8:09 talk at the beginning of the pandemic? I
8:12 can't remember when we actually recorded
8:13 that podcast, but that was probably the
8:15 worst year recruitment career.
8:18 Yeah. So,
8:19 two two years ago, so now it's 2023,
8:22 right? It was 2021 January.
8:25 Yeah. So, we we'd probably just come out
8:27 of the worst year of my recruitment
8:28 career. Um, and we were probably just
8:31 stepping into the best year of my
8:32 recruitment career. So, um, yeah, it's
8:34 been fun, man. It's been good.
8:38 So, I actually hear that. So, tell us
8:41 about your podcast.
8:43 Uh, yeah. So, the podcast was span off
8:46 of, um, in the midst of the pandemic, my
8:51 job became pretty redundant. Uh, I mean,
8:53 I didn't know many companies that were
8:56 hiring and the ones that were were
8:59 definitely not using external headliners
9:01 to find talent. So, for probably about 9
9:04 months,
9:06 I just I was like, [ __ ] I just don't
9:07 don't know what I'm going to do now
9:08 because most companies just don't want
9:10 to use me and
9:13 it's all I'm known for, right? So, what
9:14 what am I going to do? Um, so yeah, the
9:17 podcast span out of look, in that time
9:19 period, I need to do something for the
9:21 community. Um, right now I can't offer
9:24 them jobs. I can't help them get jobs.
9:27 So, what else can I do? And I've always
9:29 toyed with the idea of running a
9:31 podcast, but um, to be honest, it was
9:33 kind of always like a side note for me,
9:35 like if I get time to do it, then it'll
9:37 be something that I will do. But, um,
9:40 yeah, it kind of always got pushed to
9:41 the side. So um yeah, I thought 2020 was
9:44 the best chance to kind of launch
9:46 something like that and um yeah, I'm
9:48 really glad I did. So it's really cool.
9:50 Um again, I just talked to AI um data
9:54 science and machine learning leaders in
9:56 Germany and central Europe about their
9:58 journey within um the space that we all
10:01 work in. Um typically I'll talk to like
10:04 early stage founders and we'll talk
10:07 about their journey from the first
10:08 initial concept.
10:11 um up to where they are today and their
10:12 journey to get there. Um so yeah, it's
10:15 going well, man. Um but yeah, to be
10:18 honest, like after after the pandemic,
10:21 work like completely exploded. So I had
10:22 to take a bit of a backseat on the
10:24 podcast for a bit. Um
10:27 which was probably not my best decision
10:29 cuz we got it up to a really good stage
10:30 and then I kind of dipped off because I
10:33 was just so busy with work. Um and now
10:35 we're gradually getting it back up there
10:37 now. So we run everything on video now
10:38 and um yeah it's a slightly different
10:41 angle than what we had before but um
10:44 yeah if anyone's keen
10:46 the difference between what you do and
10:48 what I do is that yours is very
10:51 practical right people can actually
10:52 learn from the data talks podcast in one
10:55 way shape or form my podcast is a little
10:58 bit more about stories so I really want
11:01 to explain kind of the journey of
11:02 organizations and give people um an
11:05 opportunity to kind of share
11:07 their story, what the business does, um,
11:10 and ultimately just like illuminate the
11:12 companies that are working in the AI
11:14 community in Germany. Um, so yeah, if
11:18 you're interested in stories, maybe not
11:19 necessarily learning, but like
11:21 interesting conversations, then it's
11:22 probably cool to check out, but if you
11:24 want to learn stuff, stick with Alexi.
11:28 One does not exclude another, right?
11:31 Yeah. wondering if we look at the number
11:33 of podcasts created over a year like
11:36 each year and there must be a spike in
11:38 2020 right because this is where data
11:41 talks about podcast also started
11:43 probably everyone was like okay pandemic
11:45 what do we do let's
11:48 yeah it's probably like boredom had a
11:50 bit to parts playing that right it's
11:52 just something to do but
11:54 I don't know if it's just boredom but I
11:56 don't know need to be connected maybe
11:59 yeah Yeah.
12:02 Okay. So, well, you said during the
12:04 pandemic times you wanted to do
12:06 something the for the community, but you
12:08 couldn't help them get jobs. Say you
12:10 decided to do a podcast, but now you can
12:13 actually help them get jobs, right? So,
12:16 how do you do this?
12:18 Um, so clients typically work with me on
12:22 positions that they find really
12:23 difficult to fill. So um traditional
12:28 kind of data science positions I don't
12:29 get a lot of work in that kind of space
12:31 anymore. Usually what happens with most
12:34 markets is um as new things come into
12:39 the machine learning data science world
12:41 there are fewer and fewer people at the
12:42 beginning of that kind of bell curve
12:44 right of um uh like that particular
12:47 thing. So usually um clients work with
12:50 me right at the beginning of like new
12:53 things that happening in the market. So
12:54 to give you an example like MLOps is a
12:56 really hot topic for me right now. Um
12:59 most companies that I'm working with are
13:01 looking for someone or people to help
13:03 with like infrastructure and the
13:04 operational side of ML. Um but if you
13:06 ask me that like the typical roles that
13:09 I recruit for like five six years ago,
13:11 I'd say data scientists and big data
13:12 engineers. Um so my role kind of
13:15 transitions with the market. Um but yeah
13:19 customers work with me to find niche
13:21 hard to find people. Um and
13:25 my role essentially is an intermediary
13:27 between the customer and the individuals
13:30 I'm representing. So in a slightly
13:34 different way than what most of the
13:37 recruitment industry works like. I only
13:39 work with two to three customers in one
13:41 go. Um I'm only one person so I can't
13:45 work with 100 customers in at once
13:47 otherwise I just wouldn't be able to
13:48 service them. Um but yeah so I work with
13:51 two to three customers at once and I
13:54 work really really closely with them. So
13:56 the way that I typically try and frame
13:58 it with those customers is that I'm your
13:59 embedded AI talent specialist for the
14:02 time that we're working on a particular
14:04 project together. Um, but externally
14:07 with the candidates I represent,
14:11 I try and be as involved in the job
14:14 search with the individuals that I work
14:15 with as possible. So, what I don't want
14:17 to do is just be kind of like a a job
14:20 filter for people to just send them job
14:23 specs and just coordinate interviews.
14:25 That's really not what I want to do.
14:27 What I actually, this is going to sound
14:29 a bit cheesy, but what I really want to
14:30 kind of become and be known for is that
14:33 I'm a semi-career coach. That does sound
14:36 super cheesy, but ultimately I think if
14:38 you've ever worked with with me before,
14:41 um you'll know that I pretty much help
14:43 you with every single stage of the
14:45 process, be that the intro stage, be
14:48 that technical, um how to speak to VPs
14:52 and like senior management, um offer
14:54 negotiation and closing. Um pretty much
14:57 I'll hold your hand through the entire
14:59 interview process from the very very
15:00 get-go. Um, and I'll pretty much walk
15:03 people through the stages within all of
15:05 the companies I've worked with. So, um,
15:07 yeah, if you've ever worked before, I
15:09 hope you would agree with that. Um, but
15:11 yeah, so, as I say, I work pretty much
15:14 in the middle between customers and and
15:16 candidates. Um, but what I try to do is
15:18 work really, really closely with the
15:20 people that I work with.
15:23 I cannot say publicly if I worked with
15:26 you.
15:28 No.
15:31 Okay. Uh yeah, we probably should go
15:34 through each of these. U like you said
15:36 there is intro stage, technical stage,
15:38 talking to management, negotiation. I
15:41 definitely want to cover all that. But
15:42 before that, I have a very interesting
15:45 question. So now the market for all the
15:49 tech jobs seem to be like like it goes
15:54 down, right? I mean what I want to say
15:56 is like I see companies doing layoffs uh
15:59 getting the job is harder um there are
16:03 now the market is shifting from the
16:06 candidates being a candidates market to
16:09 the company's market it's harder and
16:11 harder to find position for you as a
16:14 recruiter what changed in the last six
16:17 months
16:19 um I can only talk from my own personal
16:22 experience but being really honest I've
16:25 not noticed any difference.
16:26 Okay.
16:27 Um, in big tech, yes, of course,
16:29 everything's on fire at the moment.
16:31 There's tons of layoffs happening and no
16:33 doubt people are really affected by
16:35 that. But the work that I do right now,
16:40 honestly, it's not it's not any
16:42 different. Um, I mean, this week I've
16:45 brought on well, I mean, there are
16:47 potentially another two to three
16:49 customers that want to work with me
16:51 right now. Um, so I'm still at capacity
16:53 all the time. Um, that said, you know, I
16:56 don't work with everyone, so I might
16:58 have a very small window on what the
17:00 market actually looks like. Um, but for
17:03 me though, man, like
17:05 I mean, the customers that I'm working
17:06 with are still hiring. Um, they've got
17:09 the funding to do so. Maybe I'm just
17:12 lucky in the fact that the customers
17:13 that I do work with are in really good
17:15 positions. like no doubt
17:18 there's different stories across the
17:19 whole market but for me personally um
17:23 it's pretty good I mean touchwood uh I
17:26 hope that continues um but yeah as I say
17:30 man like right now I mean I feel like
17:32 I'm in a pretty good position and I feel
17:34 like the clients I'm working with are in
17:35 pretty good positions um so it's really
17:38 difficult because I don't know the
17:39 entire market right but this small
17:41 subsection of the clients I work with
17:43 and who I know are in the market
17:49 seems fairly similar. Um, bar a couple
17:52 of little events that have happened, but
17:54 generally
17:57 I can see the market kind of bouncing
17:59 back within the next couple this like
18:00 I've seen this happen throughout my
18:02 career at pretty much every single
18:04 company that I work with. You'll get
18:05 huge layoffs. Um, there's tons of [ __ ]
18:08 on LinkedIn about the markets on fire
18:10 and there's going to be a huge recession
18:11 period and stuff. Um, and then in six
18:14 months time everything is kind of back
18:16 to normal. So, um, I'm not I'm not
18:19 worried about what's happening out
18:20 there, I guess, but um, maybe that's
18:22 super naive and really ignorant, but um,
18:25 yeah, from where I'm sitting right now,
18:26 man, the market's still on fire,
18:28 especially if you're good at what you
18:29 do. Um, I mean, there's always going to
18:31 be opportunities if if it's not there,
18:34 it's going to be somewhere else, right?
18:36 Um, so yeah, I mean from where I'm
18:38 sitting, man, it seems pretty good. But
18:40 I People are probably shaking their head
18:42 at me right now and thinking, well, you
18:44 don't know what I know, but um I don't.
18:46 So yeah.
18:48 Oh, it's good to be an optimist, right?
18:51 Yeah,
18:52 that
18:54 a blindist.
18:57 From what you said, it's the budgeters
19:00 budgets are still the same, right? So
19:02 they are not reducing budgets. So you
19:04 can the candidates can still get good
19:06 salaries the same salaries they were
19:08 getting previously you still have
19:10 clients clients have money um they are
19:13 in a good position so for now you don't
19:15 see any business
19:18 I don't think we've seen the full like
19:19 slowown effect of what's happened in the
19:21 it's too early to say right now right um
19:24 so it could be a very very different
19:27 market in the next six months um what I
19:30 know right now is that not much has
19:32 changed from my side Um,
19:35 so yeah, I'm not really seeing any kind
19:37 of like trickle down effects just yet.
19:39 What that looks like in 6 to 12 months,
19:41 I'm not sure. Um,
19:44 what about um like maybe it became
19:46 easier to close positions because there
19:48 are more candidates on the market or
19:50 still for the positions you work um on
19:53 it's as hard as used to be? Like nothing
19:57 changed?
19:58 Yeah, it's still hard, right? Oh, yeah.
20:00 It's all m like you know we wouldn't I
20:03 don't think I would have a job if it
20:04 ever became easy because what like if
20:06 there were a huge influx of candidates
20:09 on the market that made me redundant um
20:12 people would get them directly right and
20:14 they would just hire them directly but I
20:15 think the true value in working with a
20:17 head hunter is not necessarily the
20:19 presentation of candidates um it's much
20:22 more about the kind of process ownership
20:24 from end to end both from a client and
20:26 from a candidate perspective so um there
20:29 might be more
20:31 people on the market right now. Um,
20:35 but then there's still the same amount
20:37 of competition going after that talent.
20:39 So, that doesn't change. Um, I mean,
20:42 it's a bit messy right now, right? I,
20:44 you know, I don't know exactly how
20:45 that's going to kind of transition over
20:46 the next 6 to 12 months, but um, yeah,
20:51 for me, I've not I've really not seen
20:53 anything where I'm like, oh [ __ ] this
20:55 is a big change. So to give you an
20:57 example,
20:59 when COVID hit, that was the biggest
21:02 shock of my entire career where I was
21:03 like, "This is awful. We could
21:06 potentially go out of business and I
21:08 could run out of money." Um right now
21:11 with looking at the client pipeline that
21:12 we have um just what's happen like
21:15 generally the energy in the market
21:18 if anything I'd probably hear a little
21:20 bit more from a candidate perspective
21:21 that
21:23 they're a little bit more apprehensive
21:25 about going to startups and companies
21:26 that don't necessarily have um a route
21:29 to profitability and they're very um
21:33 there's a lot more questions that are uh
21:36 focused like funding and stability and
21:38 stuff like that that I didn't really get
21:40 in 2021. Well, I did, but not as much as
21:44 now. Um, so it's probably a little bit
21:47 more kind of like risk on the side of
21:48 the candidates right now, but generally,
21:51 I mean, as I say, compared I I compare
21:53 everything to COVID now, right? And I'm
21:55 just like, is it as bad as March 2020?
21:59 No. So, it's it's not too bad. I see. I
22:03 see. Okay. Well, the topic today is a
22:07 technical, right? just interviews and
22:10 you said that you as a recruiter you're
22:13 quite involved in the interview process
22:15 and what you do you help the candidates
22:19 at every stage which you mentioned
22:22 introduction stage then technical
22:23 interview then speaking with um top
22:27 management like PP directors and then
22:30 finally the negotiation stage. So can
22:32 you walk us through the stages? What
22:35 happens at which the stages and how do
22:37 you help candidates there?
22:40 Yeah. Um
22:42 that's quite I just want to work out
22:45 where we need to start with that so
22:47 people don't get like kind of like
22:48 overwhelmed with information because if
22:49 we do the whole thing it so if we kind
22:52 of break that down I guess and we just
22:54 do one stage at a time. Um because
22:56 personally I think that there's
22:58 different expectations for like
23:00 obviously all of those stages right and
23:02 I think the prep needs to be associated
23:04 to what we're trying to achieve in the
23:05 individual stages. So, um I think if we
23:09 just make some assumptions now, right,
23:11 because I'm going to talk really broadly
23:13 and this isn't necessarily
23:16 there are going to be some companies out
23:17 there where this doesn't it's not going
23:20 to make sense and there are going to be
23:21 some situations where they're a bit
23:23 abstract and a bit leftwing and um I
23:26 think the challenge with interviews is
23:28 that if you interview a hundred
23:30 different companies, you'll probably get
23:32 100 different experiences, right? Or at
23:34 least 50. So
23:37 take everything that I'm saying now with
23:39 like a pinch of salt and I think I put a
23:42 post out not too long ago about if
23:44 anyone wants this document then I'll
23:46 happily send that to them and if anyone
23:48 wants to talk to me about it directly um
23:50 and ask me specific questions about
23:52 specific interview processes that I'm
23:53 I'm more than happy to help. Um, but so
23:56 anyway, just that's a bit of a caveat,
23:58 but I think the assumptions that I would
24:00 make or that I've made are
24:03 this is pretty much focused towards kind
24:05 of junior to seniorish level hires,
24:07 right? Anything principal, lead,
24:10 management,
24:12 uh, any of those kinds of hires, there's
24:14 a different level of prep and different
24:16 levels of expectations.
24:18 So, I would kind of push that to one
24:19 side. Um, number two is that in the
24:23 interviews that you're going to, you're
24:24 actually capable of doing that role and
24:26 it's a logical step. So, you can't if
24:29 you're a junior engineer and you're
24:30 prepping for a CTO role, I mean, you can
24:32 prep until your eyes fall out, but
24:33 that's probably not going to happen,
24:35 right? So, number two, the roles that
24:37 you're interviewing for, you're capable
24:38 of doing. Um, it's a role that you want,
24:41 not just an interview. Um, and the
24:44 process is fairly standard. So
24:48 I mean what three stages intro technical
24:51 final stage senior management VPish kind
24:56 of uh interview that's typically what I
24:59 see maybe two stages in the technical
25:02 part but generally that's the kind of
25:04 process. Um and then yeah the last kind
25:07 of assumption that I make is that you're
25:08 working with someone who's semidecent at
25:10 giving you some information. So you're
25:12 working with either a good recruiter um
25:15 a good internal person and you know a
25:18 good HR person internally or the manager
25:21 that you're working with from a
25:23 technical side of things is a good
25:24 person um or the founder or whatever.
25:28 But you've got a contact that's
25:29 associated to that business that you can
25:31 strip information from in some sort of
25:33 way. It's not always the case, but nine
25:35 times out of 10 there'll be someone in
25:37 that chain that you'll be able to speak
25:39 to, right?
25:41 Um, does that make sense? I feel like
25:44 I've rambled my way through that,
25:45 but uh maybe we can go to the actual
25:48 stages, right?
25:49 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think
25:51 they're fair assumptions? But yeah,
25:53 cool. So, um,
25:55 so the intro meeting is obviously going
25:57 to be obviously the first stage with all
25:59 companies.
26:00 That's with you, right? Or
26:02 I don't class me as a stage in the
26:04 interview process. So it's like stage
26:06 zero sort of like they chat with you the
26:08 initial one when you reach out to date
26:12 you say hey I'm working with this client
26:14 I have this awesome role how about
26:16 having right
26:17 so that's like
26:18 you reach out then you have a
26:20 conversation that's like stage zero then
26:22 you understand okay the candidate wants
26:24 to move uh to to try this position right
26:27 and then you
26:30 what do you do you show this the CV of
26:33 the candidate to the company they say
26:35 okay let's interview that person and
26:37 then you arrange the interview and then
26:39 this is where the introduction the intro
26:42 stage happens right
26:43 yeah correct um so typically well I mean
26:46 the companies that I work with now
26:49 I've worked with them for quite some
26:51 time so usually I'll just book people in
26:53 onto the diaries because I've got such a
26:55 good understanding of what they're
26:56 looking for um I I'll send a CV as you
27:00 know just to be polite just be like hey
27:02 man I'm booking this guy in with you Um,
27:05 if you've got any questions, let me
27:06 know. But I'm kind of at a stage now
27:09 where the customers I work with, I just
27:10 know them inside out. So, um, there's
27:14 not really there's not really much
27:16 guesswork in terms of the work that I do
27:17 now. But anyway, yeah, exactly. So, the
27:19 way that you should look at me is I'm a
27:22 filter between the client, the end
27:25 client, and the candidate. So, um, I'm
27:28 not an interview. Like for me, I really
27:30 want to understand what makes you tick
27:32 as a candidate, right? Because you might
27:34 say some things to me that I think, do
27:36 you know what ma'am, that's not going to
27:38 work with this customer or that's not
27:39 going to work and that's not the right
27:40 role for you. So there's going to be
27:43 better opportunities out there that will
27:44 give you that kind of thing that you're
27:46 looking for, right? And then vice versa,
27:48 if there's parts about the cultural fit
27:51 or if there's parts about the technical
27:53 skills that I know that they definitely
27:55 need um that are going to be like an
27:57 instant reject, then that's my job to
27:59 not put forward people that are just
28:01 totally irrelevant, right? So um that's
28:03 where I sit. So um yeah, first stage is
28:06 obviously always going to be the intro
28:08 meeting, right? Um, again, there are
28:11 going to be different ways that
28:12 companies run this, but typically or 30
28:16 40 minutes of conversation. And I guess
28:18 the key thing that most people are
28:21 trying to get to in the intro stage of
28:24 of an interview is is there synergy
28:27 between us as an organization, the role
28:29 that we have open, and from a personal
28:31 perspective, does this make sense?
28:33 Right? Um, that's kind of the main goal,
28:36 but from both sides. So the prep of that
28:41 I mean if you got any specific questions
28:43 that you want me to answer about that or
28:45 Yeah. Like what does it look like? Is it
28:48 uh like tell us about yourself or there
28:51 is there's more structure?
28:53 Yeah. So I guess we'll get into the well
28:56 the typical questions that I see in that
28:58 are really broad open-ended questions
29:01 like that. Right. Um, but if we're
29:03 talking about prep specifically,
29:07 for me, I think it breaks down into
29:10 three core elements. So, number one, the
29:15 person and character that you're going
29:18 to be speaking to because ultimately in
29:20 an intro meeting, as much as it's about
29:23 outlining the skills of who you are and
29:25 what you do, it's about building the
29:27 relationship with that person. Because
29:29 if you get off a call with someone and
29:31 you have that kind of internal feeling
29:33 like yeah kind of that's kind of the
29:36 thing that we're looking for from both
29:37 sides but he she was a dick then that's
29:41 not really going to go past that first
29:42 initial stage. Right. So point number
29:45 one is about the character that you're
29:47 going to be speaking to and the
29:48 relationship between those people. Point
29:50 number two is the standard. Sorry go
29:53 ahead. I'm just trying to understand
29:55 like how does it help me as a candidate
29:58 like okay I know that the person I will
30:00 be speaking to is I don't know data
30:03 science manager in this company. So what
30:06 are my actions like do I research them
30:09 on LinkedIn? Do I think what is
30:12 interesting for them? Like do I um like
30:16 the way I told tell my story I use the
30:19 same language that they relate to they
30:21 they will relate to or how do I how do I
30:24 use this information?
30:25 Yeah. So there are there are two
30:28 elements to that. So it's the pre the
30:30 the the pre-ressearch and the immediate
30:33 things that you do on the call with that
30:34 person. Right. So, if I was going to
30:36 interview with you, Alexi, I mean,
30:39 you're a brilliant example of someone
30:41 that you could actually research. Um,
30:43 you know, a lot of people it is
30:44 difficult, but the first thing I'd do is
30:47 I'd really try and understand the person
30:49 that I'm going to speak to. So, number
30:51 one, I would ask the recruiter, the
30:53 internal person that I'm working with,
30:55 what's Alexi like? Like really, really
30:58 simply, what kind of characteristics
31:00 does Alexi have? What type of type of
31:02 communication style has Alexi got? I'd
31:04 really want to try and gauge who you are
31:06 before we jump on the call so there's as
31:09 little surprises as possible. Um, so the
31:12 person internally that you work with or
31:13 externally as a head hunter, I would be
31:16 stripping that person for information
31:18 because I want to know that when I jump
31:20 on that call, is this guy going to be an
31:23 extroverted hands wavy in the air kind
31:25 of person? Is he going to be super
31:27 direct and just get straight to the
31:29 point? Like what type of character am I
31:31 actually going to be speaking to here?
31:32 because I think the the key thing that
31:36 you need to do in that scenario is you
31:39 really need to kind of work with the
31:41 person that you're talking to. So if
31:43 we've got an ultra direct, straight to
31:45 the point manager of something and you
31:48 go in there and you want to kind of
31:49 shoot the breeze, you're just going to
31:51 annoy that person. But then equally, if
31:54 it's the other way round and you're
31:55 super direct and you just like want to
31:57 get straight to the point and get to it,
31:58 but the other person's like, "Hey man,
32:00 like how's your day going?" like, yeah,
32:01 what you get up to up to on the weekend,
32:04 if you don't match or try to at least
32:06 match the energy of the person that
32:07 you're speaking to,
32:10 there's going to be friction. And the
32:12 point I'm trying to make about
32:13 researching the person before you
32:15 actually jump into the interview is
32:17 there are a lot of signals in terms of
32:19 how people communicate. So, it would be
32:21 very easy to work you out because you
32:23 got podcast. So, you can watch them and
32:26 you can see how you can can communicate,
32:27 right? But
32:28 doesn't mean I behave like that in an
32:30 interview, right?
32:32 I probably I probably do.
32:34 You probably Yeah, I would imagine you
32:37 probably do, but
32:41 maybe there there would be a slight gear
32:43 shift, but I would say that 80%.
32:46 Um, but anyway, so the way that people
32:49 communicate online, it gives you a lot
32:51 of signals about how that person um is
32:54 going to communicate in real life. So
32:55 even the way that they would explain
32:58 what their roles are on LinkedIn for
33:00 example for me I mean I do this all the
33:02 time right but if I jump onto an
33:05 LinkedIn profile now and I'm making huge
33:07 assumptions here but like usually I can
33:10 get a really good feel for that person
33:12 before we even jump on a call and then
33:14 when we jump on like oh yeah like that
33:16 kind of makes sense right so just in
33:19 terms of like their communication style
33:20 how they write about what they do just
33:22 their their writing communication will
33:24 typically fold over to who they are as a
33:26 human being. So, um, what's the point?
33:29 Sorry, I'm rambling here, but before the
33:31 intro meeting, I want to really
33:33 understand or try to gain as much
33:36 information about the type of person
33:37 that I'm going to be speaking to, not
33:39 about the topics and the content. We can
33:41 do this, right?
33:42 So, I guess in this case, when you are
33:46 helping the candidate, when you're
33:47 working the client, you're helping
33:49 candidate, you already did this
33:50 homework, right? So then you would tell
33:52 the candidate, hey, this is this is the
33:55 person you're going to speak to, right?
33:56 So this is his this is their
33:58 personality, right? So like they prefer
34:01 to be direct. So get the
34:05 get to the point.
34:06 But if
34:08 let's say if somebody is not as lucky to
34:12 work with you, right? Somebody is going
34:14 through a different process, then this
34:16 is something they can do on their own,
34:18 right? take a look at the LinkedIn
34:19 profile, look up that person in Google,
34:23 right? Maybe there are some customer
34:24 preferences, maybe there's I don't know
34:27 talks, maybe there there is something
34:29 that can help to understand their
34:31 personality.
34:32 Yeah. I mean, and don't get me wrong,
34:34 this is not an exact science, right? So,
34:36 it's not something that if you follow
34:38 this process, you're going to get it
34:39 right 100% of the time because, you
34:41 know, some people just don't even post
34:44 on LinkedIn and they've got no online
34:45 community, right? So, how can you work
34:46 out anything?
34:50 Yeah, exactly. So, like don't get me
34:51 wrong, but you want to use these as
34:52 signals, right? So, you don't want to
34:53 make any like absolutes before you jump
34:55 into that call. You want to think, I
34:57 think this is the type of person that
34:59 he's he or she is going to be like. So,
35:01 if you can kind of get to a stage where
35:03 you're like, right, well, this is the
35:04 type of person I'm going to be talking
35:05 to. This is the type of character. This
35:08 is the type of personality. You can
35:09 start to adjust who or how you
35:11 communicate to that person. Right? The
35:14 second part in terms of the intro
35:17 meeting is you need to really quickly
35:18 assess the person on the other end of
35:21 the Zoom call or directly in front of
35:23 you or on the phone call within
35:24 literally seconds of speaking to that
35:27 person because
35:30 people will tend to like communicate in
35:32 the way that they want to communicate,
35:34 right? So you ever have a Zoom call with
35:35 me, I'm like, "Hey, how's it going?" And
35:39 that's how I communicate as a person.
35:41 I'm full of emojis and I'm like super
35:42 expressive and that kind of stuff,
35:44 right? When someone links with me on
35:45 that, the calls are really like they
35:48 they do well, right? But when I have a
35:51 call with someone and I'm like, "Hey,"
35:52 and they're like, "Hello." I'm like, "I
35:55 need to change the way I am right now.
35:57 Otherwise, I'm going to be jarring for
35:58 this person and they're going to think
36:00 I'm a dick." Right? So, there's a a
36:03 website that I'll send I'll put it on
36:05 the document, but it's called 16
36:07 personalities. Um, it's essentially like
36:09 a psychoanalysis of different
36:12 personality types, different
36:13 communication styles. I recommend it to
36:16 anyone who's interviewing to really try
36:18 to understand at least their own, but
36:20 have a good understanding of what other
36:21 people or who other people can be and
36:25 how they like to communicate. Because
36:27 the first initial 10 seconds of a
36:29 conversation if you don't pick up on
36:31 that and then you continue going down a
36:33 road of jarring completely different
36:36 energy level be that one way or another
36:40 the cool
36:42 again I don't want to talk in absolutes
36:44 but nine times out of 10 people will be
36:46 on that opposite ends of the kind of
36:48 spectrum in terms of how they're trying
36:49 to communicate to each other. So for me,
36:52 I always try and work out the
36:53 personality, character, and the person
36:56 before I do any prep. Um, because the
36:59 way that you communicate to that person
37:01 is going to be one of the most important
37:03 things you can do. The content is
37:05 obviously important, but if you deliver
37:07 it in a way that doesn't land, it's kind
37:09 of irrelevant.
37:11 Also, it's important not just for
37:12 interviews, right? But pretty much
37:14 everything else, too.
37:16 Yeah.
37:17 I don't know, dating or whatever.
37:19 Yeah.
37:19 Or like, I don't know, meeting
37:20 networking, right?
37:22 Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Like you there's
37:26 probably been times in everyone's life
37:28 where they've had a conversation with
37:30 someone and they just instantly click.
37:32 They're just like, "We get each other.
37:34 We just we're on the same wavelength,
37:36 right? This is
37:37 probably they got the same personality,
37:39 right?
37:40 Yeah. It's the same communication style
37:42 because you're
37:43 you're singing from the same himshi and
37:46 you're communicating in a way that the
37:47 other person likes to communicate and
37:49 understands and it's natural. But in
37:52 interviews obviously you don't have the
37:54 privilege of choosing who interviews
37:56 you, right? So it's not like they're one
37:58 of your friends or whatever. So you have
38:00 to deal with the person in front of you.
38:02 And I think that understanding the
38:04 personality type of the person that
38:06 you're talking to, doing your research
38:08 about that individual will give you a
38:10 good at least a good start, right? Um
38:14 I took a look at the time and realized
38:16 that the topic for this uh interview is
38:19 technical like technical, right?
38:22 Yeah.
38:22 I I love the topic like this this is
38:24 really interesting like the 16
38:25 personalities and like you know how you
38:28 assess that. Um, anything else you want
38:31 to mention on the intro meeting before
38:34 we move on to tech?
38:36 Yeah, there's one more thing. So,
38:38 typically you'll have standardized
38:40 questions. Tell me a bit about you.
38:42 What's your background? Tell me about
38:44 some projects that you've worked on.
38:45 What are you looking for? All the normal
38:47 kind of everyday recruitment stuff,
38:49 right? One more final thing on the intro
38:52 call is, well, there's a lot more in the
38:54 document, but one more for now. Um, I
38:57 would highly recommend standardizing
39:00 your answers to that and practicing them
39:02 so they are really fluent and you can
39:05 articulate who you are, what you do, why
39:08 you're looking, projects you've worked
39:09 on, examples of things that you've done
39:11 in a just just on demand. So if someone
39:14 says, "Alexi,"
39:16 sounds like Alexa, "Um, Alexi, tell me
39:18 about a project that you've worked on
39:19 that you're proud of." Cool. Here it is.
39:21 Be like an elevator pitch for pretty
39:23 much everything, right? like story about
39:26 yourself u like I don't know bunch of
39:28 projects you worked on so you should
39:30 have a story prepared for that like
39:32 concise to the point and if they ask for
39:35 it
39:37 yeah so like the star methodology if no
39:39 one's ever heard of that it's situation
39:41 task action result um it's a good thing
39:44 to kind of um work towards but if you
39:46 practice enough you can it can sometimes
39:49 feel a bit rigid if you like hey this is
39:52 the situation this is the task this was
39:54 my action that's going to come across a
39:56 bit a bit manufactured. But if you can
39:59 stick to that and wrap it into um the
40:02 normal way that you communicate so
40:04 you've done it so many times it just
40:06 becomes second nature it it's a good
40:09 kind of framework to work to I guess but
40:11 yeah standardized questions you know
40:13 pretty much what they're going to talk
40:14 to you about and what they're going to
40:15 ask you. It's going to be a get to know.
40:17 There's going to be some standard
40:18 questions. Get some good examples. Work
40:20 on them. have them so they're on demand
40:23 ready to go and you come across really
40:25 articulate because I think you don't
40:27 want to get caught out on hey man tell
40:29 me about you and it's
40:32 I mean I might like if I don't practice
40:34 uh like let's say last time I had injury
40:37 was four years ago then I might oh and
40:41 then start like the story from my
40:42 childhood
40:44 yeah yeah
40:46 probably not
40:48 yeah exactly man um but yeah so The
40:51 intro meeting for me is like quite um
40:53 that's one thing obviously this is about
40:55 technical interviewing right so um
40:59 the key go
41:02 I noticed that I cannot access slido so
41:05 if any of you are asking questions
41:08 slider just doesn't load so please put
41:11 them in the live chat and I will be able
41:12 to see them from the live chat I don't
41:14 know what happened with slider but I
41:16 imagine that there are 30 43 people on
41:20 this team right now and yeah probably
41:23 you have all the questions I
41:24 unfortunately cannot access them so
41:26 please put them in the live chat and
41:28 yeah we can maybe move on to the
41:30 technical part.
41:32 Sure. Where should we start?
41:35 So yeah like what is it like what what
41:39 is what do we usually have in the
41:41 technical like is like coding theory
41:44 questions uh what else?
41:47 Yeah. So I think probably there's mainly
41:52 three maybe four key things in the
41:55 technical thing. Um number one binary
41:59 questions. What's the answer to this?
42:01 What is the correct answer to this
42:03 thing? Um number two
42:07 what would you do or what if situations?
42:09 So what happens if this happens? How
42:12 would you deal with that? Um example
42:16 based questions. So tell me about a time
42:18 that you did this. And then lastly,
42:21 coding challenges, coding like tasks and
42:25 stuff like that, right? Um
42:28 so yeah, that's typically what I say in
42:30 the technical interview, but um I mean
42:32 again, this is why we need to be fairly
42:34 generic here is that most companies or
42:36 all companies are quite different from
42:39 how they run their interviews. Um so
42:42 this isn't like this isn't the blueprint
42:44 of how it works but generally there'll
42:46 be some kind of like technical session
42:49 in the middle. How companies frame that
42:51 is different from business to business.
42:54 What are typical questions that you see?
42:57 Of course companies are different. If
42:59 you interview with 100 companies, you
43:00 will have probably 100 different
43:03 questions. But well, some of these
43:05 questions will be probably similar. You
43:07 interview for data scientists, you will
43:09 see something that come ups comes up
43:11 often, right? So, do you know what what
43:14 kind of questions are there usually?
43:19 I don't know theory, coding.
43:21 Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. um
43:23 it's probably it's very closely aligned
43:25 to like those four types of things,
43:28 right? So again, all companies and this
43:30 is part of the prep. Um all companies
43:33 will have different expectations on what
43:35 they're going to speak to you about. So
43:37 for me, I would never prepare for
43:39 specific questions. I would practice
43:41 questions in case they come up. But when
43:44 it comes to preparation for technical
43:46 interviews, you what we need to do is
43:50 really under or try to understand the
43:52 expectations of the individual customers
43:55 that we're we're trying to work with,
43:56 right? Or the individual um companies
43:58 that we're trying to join. So the
44:01 questions I mean I could tell you some
44:03 but they're not going to be relevant for
44:04 everyone else, right? But what is
44:06 relevant is um
44:09 setting the expectations or trying to
44:11 understand the expectations of the
44:13 clients that you're interviewing with.
44:14 So again, if you had someone on the
44:16 inside or a HR talent person that you're
44:19 working with or a recruiter, when you
44:21 get to a technical interview, the first
44:24 thing that you should be asking is what
44:25 are the expectations of this interview?
44:27 You should never ever, in my opinion, go
44:30 into an interview and say it's a
44:32 technical interview and that's all you
44:34 know. That is blasphemy. In my word, um,
44:39 every single time you go into any
44:41 interview, you should really understand,
44:43 at least from an agenda perspective,
44:46 the context of what you're going into
44:48 and speaking about, right? Because you
44:50 need something to base your prep off of.
44:53 Um so yeah number one I'd always
44:56 you do this before so let's say um I'm
45:00 working with you so I am over like I
45:03 passed this introduction stage and now
45:05 you set um an interview a technical
45:09 interview with
45:11 like somebody I don't know senior data
45:12 scientist
45:14 um so what do I do I ask you or do I ask
45:16 that person like what are your
45:18 expectations in email before the
45:20 interview so I know what to expect Yeah,
45:23 this is what you're saying.
45:24 Yeah. So, let's say you got through the
45:27 the intro stage and that all went really
45:29 well. Luke, I'm really keen to continue.
45:32 Um, what's the next stage and what are
45:33 the expectations? So, if we're in that
45:35 technical stage, I I should be able to
45:37 give you a very strong or at least some
45:40 pointers in terms of what they're going
45:41 to be looking for within that technical
45:43 stage, right? And that's the kind of
45:44 baseline for your preparation. What we
45:47 don't want to do is go really broad,
45:49 really generic, and kind of not really
45:51 know what goal we're shooting at. Um yes
45:54 there are some really good sites out
45:56 there where you can go and practice like
45:57 coding questions and um le code and
46:00 hacker and code forces and stuff like
46:02 that but generally I think when we are
46:05 prepping for an organization we want to
46:08 keep it as focused towards that business
46:10 as we possibly can which leans back on
46:12 to I would only recommend that you do
46:15 this if this is like the role that you
46:17 actually want and this is the company
46:18 that you actually want because it takes
46:20 time and you need to look at the
46:22 organization ations and think well
46:24 firstly you want to ask the question
46:26 because that's going to give you the
46:27 good baseline to work on but then
46:29 secondly you want to start looking at
46:32 the individual job specs and roles that
46:34 you're applying for and interviewing for
46:36 and start to work out um
46:40 the levels of
46:43 um
46:45 essential v secondary v ideal skills
46:49 because that's going to give you the
46:51 prep and that's going to give you the
46:52 direction of how much time you put on
46:54 the prep. Because for me, I'd much
46:57 rather the candidates I work with spend
47:00 a ton of time focused on really getting
47:03 up to scratch on the core essentials of
47:05 the role, spending 20% of their re like
47:09 their prep time on like secondary
47:11 skills. And then if we've got any time
47:13 left over throughout that prep stage,
47:16 work out what else is the like ideal
47:19 other things that might be really
47:21 beneficial to the role but aren't
47:22 essential or secondary. Um, so the
47:25 questions for me are they're important
47:27 because with the customers I work with
47:28 now, I do know some of the specific
47:30 questions that they would ask. Um, but
47:34 I don't typically I don't share them
47:36 with candidates because then it will
47:37 become unfair. Like if I said this is
47:39 exactly what they're going to ask you,
47:40 then that's not fair, right? But um
47:43 anyway,
47:44 yeah, so I'll give people pointers about
47:47 the areas of what's going to get spoken
47:49 about. Um and then I'll set the
47:51 expectations for how much they should
47:54 know
47:55 or how much they should be able to
47:58 articulate themselves within those
47:59 particular things. Right. Do you mean
48:01 like how deep in theory you should go or
48:04 like you can just uh cover the basic
48:06 concepts like we don't need to go too
48:08 deep things like that right
48:10 yeah for sure so I always think it's
48:12 like if you look if you imagine like
48:14 three circles of like depth so the first
48:17 point is you know um
48:20 uh fairly basic um everyone should
48:24 understand points about this then I
48:28 would never skip over those points
48:29 because candidates sometimes s when you
48:31 think that you know it if you've not
48:33 been asked to articulate it for a while
48:35 um the fundamentals are always really
48:38 important right so I never say skip over
48:40 um the kind of basic questions and the
48:43 basic knowledge because I think that if
48:45 you get asked a question that's fairly
48:46 simple and something that you probably
48:48 do on a day-to-day basis but you you
48:50 like you don't know how to articulate
48:52 that in a really fluent way how they
48:55 read that is do you actually know
48:56 you know the answer right
48:58 yeah exactly
48:59 you don't know the answer but it's like
49:00 um you start rumbling and then you don't
49:03 feel there, right?
49:04 Yeah. So like um to give you to give you
49:07 an example, one of the questions that
49:08 catches like loads of candidates out in
49:11 one of the clients that I work with is
49:13 what do generators and decorators do?
49:18 Yeah. And tons of people use them and
49:21 they know them, but to articulate what
49:24 they do is some people get really caught
49:26 up on that and then they look at that
49:28 candidate and think didn't really know
49:30 it like didn't really explain himself
49:32 very well or herself very well on that
49:34 particular point and then it's just a
49:35 little it's not obviously a red flag but
49:37 it's a it's a cross next to your name in
49:39 terms of one of the particular things
49:41 right so I always say definitely think
49:43 about the fundamentals so you don't get
49:45 caught up on anything that you know that
49:46 you could easily work with But just for
49:50 some reason, interview nerves, being
49:52 pressured in an interview, whatever, you
49:54 just you [ __ ] that part up, right?
49:56 Anyway, so first circle, like essential
49:59 things that are real high priority and
50:00 the fundamentals. Secondary, how do we
50:03 level that up now? Like what's the more
50:05 difficult versions of this? And if I was
50:08 interviewing you, what would what would
50:10 my question be that's going to be a
50:13 follow-up question to what I've just
50:15 answered? like how do we make that
50:18 question I've just answered correctly 10
50:20 times harder like what's the what's the
50:22 natural follow-up stage there
50:23 that's what I do usually like I don't
50:25 have a list questions I ask I just uh
50:27 yeah tell me about the project you
50:29 worked on and then the person tells
50:31 about the project and they say okay I
50:33 use this model like I don't know random
50:35 forest and then I tell me about a random
50:37 forest words
50:38 and then um and then I like start
50:41 digging like every time you say
50:43 something I try to you know pull follow
50:45 up and then yeah exactly I guess some
50:48 people have different interview styles
50:50 right some people just have questions
50:51 and then they maybe don't dig deeper but
50:54 want to check your
50:56 like the breadth of your knowledge right
50:59 yeah but then if that is the case we
51:02 should know that
51:03 right if so if
51:07 if if someone's going in for a like a
51:09 breadth interview where they want to see
51:11 how much you know in cloud and x and y
51:13 and zed and all of these areas is then
51:16 that's what we should be prepping for.
51:18 But we can't do that if we don't know
51:20 the expectations from the business or
51:23 from the recruiter or from the internal
51:25 talent person. Right? So for me I always
51:27 think that all businesses should not
51:29 give people the answers and not give
51:31 people like so much information that
51:33 they can kind of they can walk through
51:36 the interview process easy because it
51:37 does need to be in my opinion it needs
51:39 to be tough and we need to work out if
51:40 people can actually do it and they can
51:42 think from themselves and all of that
51:44 sort of stuff. But you can't set people
51:46 up to fail. Like you can't be like,
51:48 "Turn up for a technical interview and
51:49 we'll see how you go." Like that for me
51:51 is [ __ ] So I think we definitely
51:54 need to at least have context about
51:56 what's going to get spoken about and
51:58 then you can prep for it, right? But
51:59 then it still follows the same principle
52:01 in my eyes like what's the follow-up
52:03 question to this particular thing like
52:06 what kind of flowchart would I ask
52:07 candidates or would I ask myself if I
52:10 was interviewing that will make this
52:11 difficult? And then that gives you a lot
52:13 more of a kind of like free flow free
52:15 flowing prep rather than being like I
52:18 think they're going to talk about this.
52:19 I think they're going to talk about
52:20 this. Realistically,
52:22 if we're talking about this particular
52:24 subject, most companies interview in the
52:26 same sort of way as you do. So, let's
52:28 talk about this particular question.
52:30 Let's see how they answer it and then
52:31 let's stem from that particular answer.
52:34 Um, so if I was prepping for like if I
52:37 was a machine learning engineer, data
52:38 scientist, this is how I would prep. I'd
52:40 be like, "Right, let's start on
52:41 something that we definitely know is
52:43 going to get spoken about." Outside of
52:45 that, how how do we work around that to
52:47 build more of a um breadth, but also
52:51 depth within that particular thing,
52:53 right? Um
52:56 I'm rambling now, but I'm just thinking,
52:59 how do I stop you?
53:03 No, it's fine. I'm joking. So, I see
53:05 that we have three questions. I maybe
53:07 it's time we actually covered them. So
53:09 the first question is what think of
53:11 companies that mainly ask very
53:12 theoretical questions as if data
53:14 scientists should all know mathematical
53:17 and statistical force.
53:22 I think it's if it's relevant for that
53:24 business
53:25 then it's valid but I think
53:30 how often is it relevant? Sometimes I
53:32 feel like people don't know what to ask
53:34 the internet and just they just Google a
53:36 list of questions and this list is
53:38 theoretical and just fire this
53:40 questions.
53:41 Yeah. So if it's completely abstract,
53:43 these are our interview questions for no
53:45 other reason apart from these are kind
53:47 of the right things that you would ask
53:48 in an interview for a data scientist
53:50 then no that's [ __ ] Like all of the
53:53 interviews in my opinion should work
53:57 backwards from the job responsibilities
53:59 and what they're going to do on a
54:00 day-to-day basis. So if that's something
54:02 that they're never going to touch or
54:04 don't need to know, then why why ask it?
54:07 Like what's the point?
54:09 Cuz you skided this at university. You
54:11 had really hard time and you feel like
54:13 everyone should also know the answers to
54:15 this question.
54:16 Yeah, I mean I've I've heard that before
54:19 from clients I work with. Um, but
54:23 how much impact does that have on a
54:26 candidate's ability to do the job right
54:28 now if they can recall something that
54:30 they left like learned six, seven,
54:32 eight, nine years ago of a very like
54:35 specific
54:37 like thing? What impact is that going to
54:40 have on if they can do that right now? I
54:42 guess the
54:44 the flip side to that is no, I don't
54:47 think there's a flip side actually. Um,
54:48 I think they're [ __ ]
54:53 I'm checking the second question from so
54:56 how do you keep going with an interview
54:58 if you flopped in between and feel
55:00 uncomfortable?
55:02 What does flopped mean? It's like when
55:04 you failed
55:05 like if they've just if they bombed it.
55:07 Um
55:08 bond means like if you kind of failed,
55:10 right? If you didn't do
55:11 you [ __ ] it up. Yeah. Um
55:13 now it's 18 plus podcast.
55:17 Sorry man.
55:19 Um, so I guess it depends. Sorry, I know
55:23 it's a really awful answer, but um I I
55:26 guess it depends on
55:29 how you've bonded and like how that
55:33 feels in the scenario. Like it would be
55:36 good if they could give me a little bit
55:37 more of a specific, but and it depends
55:40 if you really want that job. So if I've
55:42 bombed in I've bonded in an interview
55:43 before, like absolutely.
55:46 and um but I really wanted to work
55:48 there. So my it didn't it didn't work
55:51 out in the end but I've got nothing to
55:52 lose at this stage. Right? So if you
55:54 bomb in an interview and you think I can
55:56 do better than that. That was just a
55:58 really bad day for me. I'd tell them I
56:00 would go back and I've had multiple
56:02 people that I've worked with who have
56:04 bombed interviews and I've said look
56:07 take four weeks we're going to prep on
56:09 these particular things that you
56:10 absolutely bombed on and then we're
56:12 going to retake that interview with that
56:13 client. Um, and people have got jobs
56:15 from that. Um, so that's cool.
56:18 So,
56:19 it happens. It happens.
56:20 Yeah, 100%. But like for me, like when I
56:24 b something,
56:26 yeah, when I failed something, then I
56:28 just, okay, I should have answered it
56:30 this way and then I do some research and
56:31 I okay like this is this is what the
56:34 answer should be. And then I just don't
56:36 do anything else. Just next time this
56:39 question comes up, maybe I answer it
56:41 better, but that's that's it. But what
56:42 you say is instead of you know just uh
56:45 you know working through this and
56:47 thinking of better answer you reach out
56:50 to the company and say look I had a bad
56:52 day this is um like I did a bit of uh
56:55 thinking and they want to retake it and
56:58 some companies actually agree to
57:01 interview for four weeks after
57:03 and then they and then they take those
57:05 people in the end. Yeah. So, there's
57:08 three examples I've got in my mind right
57:09 now of people that have done that over
57:11 the past like year with me. Um, but
57:14 anyway, so if you if you bombed an
57:16 interview, this all depends on if you
57:19 really want it. If you really want it,
57:20 then what have you got to lose, right?
57:22 You should definitely go for it. But if
57:25 you bombed an interview and you think,
57:26 "Oh, this is it's not for me anyway. I
57:30 mean, I would just wrap that interview
57:31 up really quickly and then just get out
57:32 there." But if you think I bomb that and
57:35 I want it exactly how you said, I would
57:39 message the person that's just
57:40 interviewed me and they'll be like,
57:41 "Alexi, I absolutely bombed that
57:44 interview and that was awful. Um, I can
57:46 100% do better than that. Will you just
57:48 do me a favor and give me three to four
57:50 four weeks? Let me come back and retake
57:52 that.
57:53 Can we do that?" Most people would say,
57:56 "Yeah." I'm just wondering what would I
57:59 do if I get if I received a request like
58:01 that and what our recruiter would tell
58:04 me to do. I never received a request
58:06 like that.
58:08 That's it.
58:10 I think someone who's listening to this
58:13 interview right now and then we'll have
58:15 an interview with me and hopefully you
58:17 don't bomb it but in case it happens
58:19 but the risk
58:20 sometimes. Sorry,
58:22 just one more thing on that. So, the
58:24 risk there is that you do that and then
58:26 you bomb again.
58:28 Oh, yeah. Oops.
58:29 And um I've had that and it is
58:32 heartbreaking to be like, "Sorry, man.
58:34 You still wasn't good enough." Um that's
58:38 the risk that you take, but if you
58:40 really want the thing that you're going
58:41 after, I mean, I would take that risk
58:43 every day.
58:46 Question from Alvin. Is it okay to apply
58:48 to different roles in the same company
58:50 within a short amount of time?
58:53 if it's relevant. Um,
58:57 yeah, but I wouldn't like pepper gun a
58:59 company and apply for everything. Like,
59:01 so I
59:03 I mean, there are some people that would
59:05 look at that and think, oh, that's a bad
59:07 sign. I don't really see it as a bad
59:09 sign. Um, as long as the I just think
59:12 it's a bit lazy um to be like, apply all
59:15 click click click click click. Um
59:17 because I've seen people that have
59:18 applied for like work student jobs and
59:20 then senior and principal engineers like
59:22 that's you're you're not looking at what
59:25 you're doing, right? So um I don't think
59:28 it's a bad thing, but just make sure
59:29 it's super relevant and just keep it
59:30 focused towards what you actually want
59:32 to do. So um but I think we spoke about
59:35 this last time. I think the best thing
59:36 you can do is actually just reach out to
59:37 the right people and speak to them
59:38 directly. Otherwise, you just get put
59:40 into a black hole of 10,000 other
59:42 applications and you're probably never
59:44 contacted. Um for me the standing out
59:47 part is about being different and doing
59:49 something differently. So
59:52 I would personally just reach out to the
59:54 people and say this is what I want to do
59:55 and this is where the impact I can have
59:57 with you guys. This is the impact I can
59:59 have with you guys. These are the roles
1:00:00 I'm thinking about what what should I
1:00:02 apply for and where should I go?
1:00:05 Yeah, I can add to that that I also see
1:00:08 nothing wrong. So we sometimes have
1:00:11 positions that look similar but they're
1:00:13 from different teams
1:00:16 to apply to them and then yeah talk to
1:00:18 the recruiter on the first interview say
1:00:21 that yeah apply to actually and we
1:00:24 should be wrapping up. So the last thing
1:00:26 I want to ask you if you have any book
1:00:29 or other resource recommendations that
1:00:31 you can give to listeners.
1:00:34 Yeah. Um, so on this document, I mean, I
1:00:38 tell everyone now, um, Le Code, hacker
1:00:41 rank, code forces, algo monster, um,
1:00:44 educative, I don't know if you've ever
1:00:45 heard of them before. They're really all
1:00:47 of that if you want to practice just
1:00:50 questions and interview questions and
1:00:51 engineering questions and um, science
1:00:54 questions. They're really, really good.
1:00:55 Um, they're really I know there's a lot
1:00:58 of controversy about leak code questions
1:01:00 and all of this sort of stuff, but
1:01:03 companies run interviews like that. So,
1:01:04 if you want to practice, they're really
1:01:06 good places to start. Um, but then
1:01:09 equally, um, as I say, this document
1:01:11 that I'm putting together about
1:01:12 interview prep, I'm really sorry we
1:01:13 didn't get to really dive into like a
1:01:15 lot of the topics today, but this
1:01:17 document
1:01:18 Yeah. Um, this document, I'm going to
1:01:21 work on it and I'm going to expand on
1:01:22 it. So, if anyone wants it, reach out to
1:01:24 me on LinkedIn and give me a couple of
1:01:27 days to make it look like it's not been
1:01:28 written by a 5-year-old and then I'll
1:01:30 happily share that with everyone.
1:01:33 Okay. yours, right?
1:01:37 Yeah.
1:01:40 Potentially not.
1:01:42 Is there any chance we could include it
1:01:44 in the show notes? It will be released
1:01:46 like in a couple of weeks.
1:01:48 Sure. Yeah. Um yeah, as I say, man, just
1:01:52 give me a couple of days and I'll jazz
1:01:54 that up and then we'll uh Yeah, we'll
1:01:56 add it in.
1:01:57 Okay. It's always pleasure talking with
1:01:59 you. So, second time was fun. Maybe we
1:02:02 should in a couple of years do the third
1:02:04 one.
1:02:05 Yeah, I'll see you in two years, man.
1:02:08 Maybe earlier.
1:02:09 Yeah, thanks for joining us. Thanks
1:02:11 everyone for joining us, too. Thanks for
1:02:13 questions. I hope you enjoyed it and
1:02:15 have a great weekend.
1:02:17 Cool. Okay, guys.
