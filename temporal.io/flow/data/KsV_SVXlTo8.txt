Indie Hacking

0:00 This week we will talk about indie
0:01 hacking and we have a special guest
0:03 today pollen. Uh pollen is a data
0:06 science manager and a consultant at ABM
0:09 IBM where she has worked for eight
0:11 years. She's also an indie hacker and is
0:14 working on a few side hustles in crypto
0:16 and generative AI. And one of her latest
0:18 projects allows uploading a few selfies
0:20 and it generates a lot of cool and
0:22 stylish stylish pictures and I use this
0:26 service too. Um so welcome pollen. Hi.
0:30 And I I'm glad to be invited here. I
0:34 don't see anyone, but uh I guess there's
0:36 some people.
0:37 Yeah, let let me just
0:39 open um I'll open YouTube from my phone
0:43 so I make sure I don't miss any
0:44 questions. So today I didn't create a
0:46 slider link
0:48 um because we were late and I was
0:50 struggling with um
0:53 I was struggling with Zoom. So today you
0:56 put all the questions if you have any
0:58 questions during today's conversation
0:59 please put them in the live chat and I
1:01 will be covering these questions and
1:05 also the questions for today's interview
1:07 were prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks
1:09 Johanna for your help and uh now let's
1:12 start before we go into our main topic
1:14 of indie hacking. Let's start with your
1:16 background. Can you tell us about your
1:18 career journey so far?
1:20 Yeah sure. So I started as an engineer
1:23 and when I um I studied engineer at
1:26 school but at this time eight years ago
1:29 uh data science was very new so there
1:32 wasn't any curses about it uh just one
1:36 in France actually but I wasn't in this
1:38 school and uh so well uh I applied to
1:42 IBM because it was my dream to work
1:45 there and uh well it was a match I was
1:49 accepted Um I started as a junior data
1:53 scientist but as I didn't learn it
1:55 before because there wasn't any
1:58 uh I I learned by myself and uh then I
2:02 became a senior consultant in data
2:06 science two years later and it's been um
2:09 yeah three or four years I'm a manager
2:12 now
2:14 and aside of this I am an ND actor uh
2:17 from I beginning this this here. Uh it's
2:20 been a year actually more or less
2:23 exactly one year and uh yeah but we will
2:26 tell more about it in this interview.
2:30 Okay. So your first job after graduating
2:32 was IBM and you you're still at IBM.
2:36 I'm still at IBM. Yes.
2:37 That's that's very impressive. People
2:39 usually don't stick around for that long
2:42 at one company.
2:44 Uh yes I know
2:45 you must like your job really like you
2:48 must like it a lot.
2:49 Yes, it's I like it indeed.
2:53 So, what do you do as a data consultant
2:55 at IBM?
2:58 Um, yeah, when you are a data
3:00 consultant, it means uh I work in data
3:04 science area but for various clients.
3:07 Uh, I'm work from project to project. A
3:10 project is a mission. It can be it can
3:13 last one month or uh four years. For
3:16 example, I think my shortest mission
3:20 lasted uh one month and the the longer
3:24 one uh two years. So it really depends
3:27 and uh I see various clients, various
3:31 domain. I'm not specialized in business
3:34 uh in a special this business. So I work
3:37 in um banks uh uh special uh automotive
3:44 and also on different data science
3:47 context which can be like predict sales
3:50 or uh explanability models. So yeah it's
3:55 a a whole uh yeah I'm not specialized
3:59 and it's a choice actually. Mhm. So the
4:02 way it works is a customer approaches
4:04 IBM says hey I have this kind of project
4:08 uh give us some people to work on this
4:10 project and you uh along um with your
4:14 team you join the client and you work
4:16 with them on a particular project right
4:18 yes exactly usually I have I I'm working
4:21 on a team and um there is like two or
4:26 four data scientists I'm working with
4:29 and I'm more in the managing part now
4:31 but I can also do the models and help by
4:34 by coding usually in Python most of the
4:37 time.
4:39 What do you do as a managing partner?
4:41 What kind of responsibilities do you
4:43 have?
4:44 I'm not a partner but uh
4:46 as managing consultant right or
4:50 Yeah. Yes. As manager you like you
4:53 ensure that the models are created that
4:56 it fits the client's needs. uh you also
5:00 uh you are also uh the relation between
5:03 the clients and the team um like I can
5:08 present the results um what what we
5:11 achieved what is in the road map uh that
5:14 kind of of tasks
5:18 okay yeah interesting and uh I don't
5:20 know if you can discuss that but maybe
5:23 if you can um what are some interesting
5:27 projects that you worked on at IBM.
5:31 Yes. Um I I won't name the clients but
5:34 uh I worked for uh two years to detect
5:38 some laundry money and uh that was
5:42 laundry money.
5:43 Yeah.
5:44 Laundrying money laundering. Okay.
5:46 Yes. Oh yes. Sorry. I know it's
5:50 but uh yeah and it was very interesting
5:52 because I had to think as a person that
5:56 can do money laundering and um so I I
6:00 have the
6:02 like they say okay I have this data what
6:04 can I do and I was uh working on two
6:08 years past data so I had to build in
6:12 team not just me uh a model a system to
6:17 to detect
6:18 yeah strange behavior let's say
6:23 so how can uh you think as a money
6:26 launderer
6:28 uh but first there is some patterns that
6:32 are famous like I don't know you are uh
6:35 you do some sport with pets and you say
6:39 okay I think it's a tennis match for
6:41 example Nadal Federer and you say okay
6:44 Nadal is will win and you also bet that
6:48 Feder will win. So at in the end you
6:51 will have um spend some money on both.
6:54 So of course you will lose money but the
6:57 aim is not to uh for someone who want to
7:00 do money laundry. He doesn't want to
7:02 earn money but to lose the less
7:04 possible.
7:05 Mhm. Okay. That's a nice strategy.
7:08 Yeah. And what was interesting is that I
7:11 I started uh to frame the project and I
7:15 see it until the end uh the deployment
7:19 the deployment part. Yes.
7:23 Okay. Yeah, that's all quite interesting
7:25 and I want to ask more but that's not
7:28 the main topic today, right? So the main
7:30 topic today is what you started one year
7:31 ago as you said uh it's indie hacking.
7:35 So maybe can you tell us what indie
7:38 hacking actually is?
7:39 Uh hunting is uh when you are building
7:43 projects. I I'm not sure if if this is
7:46 the exact definition but uh it's to
7:49 build project and to monetize them. Um
7:54 so without any funding like when you
7:57 what was famous before because I think
8:00 this is a new trend. Um what was famous
8:04 before is you have a project you pitch
8:06 deck you do a pitch deck and you are
8:09 trying to find investors uh to invest
8:12 invest fund in your in your company but
8:16 I won't I don't do this I build uh with
8:21 another friend we are free actually but
8:24 two of us build it and the other one
8:27 help us with administrative
8:29 and legal and Um and yes we build this
8:34 at our on our free time. So
8:39 it's we don't have any pressure. We
8:41 don't uh we launch when we can like we
8:45 start we wanted to launch something this
8:48 week but it will be delayed but it's
8:51 okay. We don't have any pressure nobody
8:53 knows about it. So yeah that's uh my
8:56 definition. Mhm. So basically during uh
8:59 daytime you work at IBM as a manager,
9:02 data science manager, but after work
9:05 after I don't know 5:00 p.m. or 6 p.m.
9:08 you start you work on your side
9:10 projects.
9:12 Yes, exactly. And during weekend most
9:15 during weekend and it was great because
9:18 in December I had a lot of holidays so I
9:21 could have I worked a lot on my project.
9:24 Yeah, I know in France you get a lot of
9:27 holidays, right? A lot of vacation days.
9:29 Uh, yes, we have quite a lot.
9:31 Yes. So that's a good country for indie
9:33 hacking, right?
9:34 Yes.
9:35 So indie, I guess means independent,
9:38 right? So that's the part that you set
9:40 that you don't get any funding from
9:42 anyone. You just start uh working on a
9:45 project and then you see what happens.
9:47 And the goal that you have is monetizing
9:49 this project, earning money with this
9:51 project.
9:52 Yes, exactly. It it doesn't cost a lot.
9:55 It's just servers. But we don't need
9:57 funding.
9:59 Why? Why hacking? Why hacking though? So
10:02 indie is independent, but why hacking?
10:04 Why not just indie um I don't know
10:06 projects or indie work or
10:09 Yeah,
10:09 hacking is more attractive or what?
10:11 I'm not the one who invented this word
10:13 to be honest. I I review it. I don't
10:17 know. Some people say indie maker, some
10:21 others say bootstrappers.
10:23 So there are different synonyms and well
10:26 I don't know but uh I use it.
10:30 Um some time ago I was into games and in
10:33 games there was also this concept of
10:35 indie um developers. So usually there is
10:39 like when you have a game then you work
10:42 with some sort of a publisher right? who
10:44 then promotes the game, distributes it,
10:47 right? But there are some indie
10:48 developers who don't rely on these
10:50 publishers on this network. So they just
10:53 create a game and then they use their
10:54 own channels for distribution. I guess
10:57 uh it's kind of a similar idea but here
10:59 like instead of uh finding you have
11:02 independent channels, right?
11:04 Yes.
11:06 Okay. and uh tell us about your projects
11:09 that you do as a part of your um indie
11:13 hacking.
11:14 Yeah, so this everything started with um
11:18 Cryptopy that it's my first project. Uh
11:21 actually Cryptop was at the very
11:23 beginning it was uh me. I was um I did
11:27 some trading of crypto and I I noticed
11:32 some patterns uh in charts and I was
11:36 like okay uh that could be great to
11:39 automate some things that could me could
11:41 tell me whenever uh a crypto
11:45 react in some way. I was trading with
11:48 technical indicators
11:50 and um so at this time it was I think
11:54 five years ago I I had I hadn't very
11:58 much um development skills so it was two
12:03 years ago I during the covid um
12:07 we couldn't uh we we were allowed to
12:10 travel in France but uh we had to be
12:14 there on night at home it was I think is
12:17 called ceasefire in English. Not sure.
12:19 Yeah, curfew. No, curfew.
12:22 Yeah,
12:22 I think it's curfew. So, yes. And I I
12:26 visited some friends and one of uh them
12:29 is developer. So, I I told her, hey, do
12:33 you want to work with me on this
12:35 project? Uh because it it really took a
12:38 lot of time to trade and uh she said
12:41 yes. So we built our own solution to to
12:45 be alerted whenever a crypto matches our
12:49 our strate strategy and um we used it we
12:54 also automat automated some part to
12:57 trade but uh we used it for a year and
13:01 it was very profitable and so I thought
13:04 okay it's uh great for us so maybe we
13:07 can also offer it to others. So we
13:12 launched an offer of alert alerting
13:16 uh in crypto. Yeah. It was in September
13:19 that we launched the offer.
13:21 Okay. So first you use it for your own
13:24 um only for yourself, right? So you use
13:26 it for training trading crypto and it
13:29 wasn't public, right? So just you and
13:31 your friend uh used it
13:33 but uh but then you thought um it could
13:36 be useful for others too and then you
13:38 made made it public.
13:40 Exactly. We we used it privately and uh
13:43 but the company was created in January
13:47 of last year. Uh but in September we
13:50 launched the offer. Um and uh and it
13:54 wasn't a success at all.
13:56 It wasn't
13:57 No, no, no, no, no. It's it's very hard
14:01 because this is not my audience. Um I I
14:07 don't know a a lot of traders so it's
14:11 hard to be known in this uh domain and
14:14 it's okay I mean we build it for us so
14:17 we learn from it but uh that was the
14:20 beginning and then we say okay but we
14:22 launched one offer why not launch
14:24 something else.
14:26 But at least you made money with this
14:28 tool anyways for for your own trading.
14:31 Uh yes.
14:32 Okay. So that was useful anyway.
14:35 Yes.
14:36 And yeah, you said it wasn't successful
14:39 at the end, but I'm still curious like
14:41 between the time you realized that uh
14:44 it's useful for others and the time when
14:46 you actually launched it, what happened
14:49 the um what happened
14:52 like how did it go from like what did
14:54 you do exactly? Um from that moment to
14:57 you said in January you opened the
14:59 company, you started the company, right?
15:01 Then you were doing something in other
15:04 months, right? Between January and
15:06 September. So what did you do there?
15:08 Uh oh, between January. In January, we
15:12 we created the company because it was
15:15 better for us to have money in common.
15:18 We used both uh our system on our sides.
15:22 So we had to maintain two system which
15:24 was a bit uh time consuming. And uh so
15:28 we decided to create one company in
15:30 order to join our investing money and
15:33 maintain only one solution. So that's
15:36 why and uh then I think it was in August
15:39 that we say okay we can launch an offer
15:42 and it was very quick to transform it to
15:46 um to an offer because everything was
15:51 coded. So we just had to do a landing
15:55 page um and uh yeah a bit of legals
16:00 thing like that things like that but it
16:02 wasn't it didn't take much time.
16:05 Mhm.
16:06 And what did you use for the landing
16:08 page?
16:10 What did I use? Uh I
16:12 what is this maybe? Can you tell us what
16:13 what it is? Why do do you need a landing
16:15 page? like isn't just it's enough to
16:18 just create uh like the app and expect
16:20 people to join it.
16:22 Uh but but you need uh well by landing
16:26 pages of our website. I mean if the app
16:29 it's not an app on on the mobile or
16:32 something like that. So you have to like
16:35 people has to know about it. So we yes
16:38 we created a landing page and I created
16:41 from scratch. Um I think I had on on my
16:46 side because I already built some
16:48 websites so I reuse a lot and change
16:53 uh of course the content images etc. But
16:57 yeah just use something like bootstrap I
16:59 guess and then put some text there and
17:01 uh like a button sign up here right
17:03 that's what the landing page is.
17:05 Exactly. Yes.
17:06 Mhm. Okay. So you did this and then you
17:09 said you also said that you needed to
17:11 take care of some legal part.
17:14 So what was there? What did you need to
17:16 take care of?
17:18 Uh yes because when you we didn't you it
17:22 was a product to monetize. So you have
17:25 to take care of doing I don't know the
17:28 privacies or terms of use things like
17:32 that. And u uh also you have to think
17:36 about okay um if I want to monetize I
17:40 also need a payment system so find it
17:43 and um and uh integrate it to our app.
17:48 Uh yes that kind of things that you
17:51 don't have to to think about if you
17:53 build it for only yourself.
17:55 Mhm.
17:57 Okay. So this privacy policy and all
17:59 these things I guess. So you you don't
18:01 want to get sued, right? If somebody
18:03 loses money.
18:05 Yes. No, I don't. So we say we are not
18:09 advice or at the first at first we
18:13 wanted to let people uh automate their
18:15 trade. But uh it's legally it's very
18:19 complicated. So we don't we just let
18:22 people uh say their strategy and they
18:25 are alerted when the crypto match their
18:29 strategy. Mhm. And what does your friend
18:32 uh do? Is she also in data science or
18:35 she's a developer?
18:37 No, she's a Java developer.
18:39 Java developer. Okay.
18:40 Yeah.
18:41 Is this what you used for uh Cryptopy?
18:45 Java?
18:46 No, we used
18:48 Well, we used Python because I wanted to
18:52 be able to modify the code. Um and also
18:57 because uh with Python there is a
18:59 framework that you can use for web
19:01 development. It's called flask.
19:04 So we used it
19:06 but uh we could also have uh used Java
19:10 and uh do some front with this but this
19:13 is not a technology I I I know.
19:16 So yes we use Python and the last there
19:21 is one feature that she did in in Java.
19:24 Mhm. I see. Um so you both work on uh
19:28 everything or how do you split
19:29 responsibilities between the two of you?
19:32 Um so for Cryptopia I think uh at first
19:36 it was equally uh for the development uh
19:40 and then when we say uh we thought about
19:43 uh doing an offer for people uh so to
19:47 launch our offer uh we split it and she
19:50 she does the development development and
19:53 I'm more in the marketing part um and
19:57 trying to find relation relationships
20:00 etc.
20:02 So what what do you do in marketing? So
20:03 it's I guess mainly promoting letting
20:06 people know that this thing exists,
20:08 right? So you said you you said that you
20:10 had problems with this. So how did you
20:12 try to to approach that?
20:13 H yeah for for cryptop it was very
20:16 difficult I and it was also my very
20:19 first experience because as you know uh
20:21 my real job my day job is uh is in data
20:27 science so it's not related to
20:29 marketing.
20:31 um it can be by exploring some marketing
20:34 models but it's not the same as doing a
20:36 marketing and uh yeah so I tried like to
20:39 join some Facebook groups or Reddit but
20:43 I was banned
20:45 very quickly I said okay this is not the
20:48 good approach. So I I started Twitter
20:52 also this summer. So I I um I thought
20:56 okay I could use Twitter to speak to
20:58 people and uh yeah so I did this but um
21:02 very quickly we noticed that um it was
21:05 very difficult to reach an audience for
21:09 crypto traders. I also um contacted a
21:13 lot of people from crypto influencers
21:17 etc. But well influencers are very
21:21 difficult to reach. It's you have to get
21:24 money too.
21:25 Mhm.
21:26 Yeah. But uh so we couldn't afford it
21:30 but um so yes very quickly we said okay
21:33 it will be very difficult to monetize
21:35 this offer. So we leave it like that and
21:39 um and we will start to build other
21:43 project and that's also when I started
21:46 but before we go into your second
21:48 project I'm really curious about that
21:49 too. Maybe you can mention how much it
21:51 costs you to maintain this thing, Ryan.
21:53 So you said you are not actively working
21:55 on this right now. It's just there, but
21:57 I guess it's also you have to pay for
22:00 hosting and for other things. I'm
22:02 wondering how expensive it is to just
22:04 let it run in the background.
22:06 Yeah, it cost about about €10 uh a
22:10 month.
22:11 Not that expensive, guess.
22:13 No, that's okay.
22:16 Well, I guess if more people start using
22:17 it, it will be more expensive, right?
22:20 Um, yeah, probably, but not that much
22:24 because uh, yeah, I'm not sure it will
22:27 be very much more costly because it
22:29 doesn't use much databases and yeah, so
22:33 I don't know.
22:34 Okay. And I guess this is uh, from what
22:36 I see uh, I saw some other
22:41 ideas or some other projects in this
22:42 space of indie hacking. Most of these
22:44 projects are rather small. They are
22:46 quite small. They are focused on a
22:48 specific problem and uh yeah is it the
22:52 correct obser observation.
22:54 So you want
22:56 most of the projects in in the hacking
22:58 space they are very small. They focus on
23:00 a specific problem and they they don't
23:02 do much except for solving this
23:04 particular problem.
23:05 Yes. Yes. It's called like niche market
23:09 and uh yeah it's a way of uh yeah what
23:15 this is exact and uh so you try to
23:18 validate an idea so you start with a
23:20 small project if it works then you
23:24 invest more time uh to improve it and if
23:27 it doesn't you have to say okay I exit
23:30 and you start another one. Mhm. So tell
23:34 us about the other one you had.
23:36 Yeah. So I was actually in a holidays uh
23:40 and u I saw um
23:44 I saw dream booof and uh also uh someone
23:49 called Levelio on Twitter that uh
23:52 explained that he built a system to um
23:57 where you can send picture of yourself
23:59 and it transform it to new pictures. So
24:03 I was wondering how he did this. So I I
24:06 I made some research and finally I told
24:12 about it to my my friends uh to start
24:16 this and she say yes let's do the same.
24:18 So we don't we didn't reinvent the
24:22 wheel.
24:24 uh but uh we wanted to try it and um so
24:28 we launched very quickly because it's um
24:32 um we had most of the development done.
24:36 So um yeah I think we launched in a few
24:41 weeks after the idea. So it was a kind
24:45 of a side of side project because um
24:49 first uh because we have our work and uh
24:52 also because uh we were actually working
24:56 on a on a Twitter tool uh that we I hope
25:00 we will launch very soon.
25:02 Mhm. Okay. So you said that this uh this
25:06 project it's called Unrealme IO, right?
25:09 Yes. Yes. Um, so this project you send a
25:12 few pictures of yourself and then what
25:14 it does it uses Dream Booth. You said
25:17 like it uses something uh to create new
25:21 pictures from the pictures you sent.
25:23 Yes.
25:24 Mhm. So, and you said you first saw a
25:27 tweet and then you thought, okay, I can
25:29 do this. Uh, and then you contacted your
25:32 friends who like the idea and you
25:34 released it in a couple of weeks.
25:36 Exactly. So can I can you walk us
25:39 through like how did it what exactly did
25:41 you do from seeing this between seeing
25:43 this tweet and actually releasing what
25:45 what did you need to do? Um okay so
25:48 first we we studied and we were
25:51 wondering okay uh should we uh start
25:54 from scratch uh with dream booof dream
25:58 that it's um a library and uh a model
26:04 and um should we use it with our own GPU
26:08 because u as it's fine tuning um images
26:12 it uses GPU and it's very expensive.
26:16 Um so we had this choice or otherwise we
26:20 could use an an API to uh do the fine
26:24 tuning. So we choose solution two
26:27 because we want it to be fast
26:31 and um and uh yeah so what happened it's
26:35 uh we have this idea so we have to build
26:38 a system to uh do the IPA calls and uh
26:42 also to store images of the people in
26:46 case um to send it and to get the
26:50 result. Um when the result is done we
26:54 have to store it and send uh send the
26:57 picture to the persons. Um and also we
27:01 so we have this to do and also to launch
27:05 like talking about it um in the in
27:09 Twitter mainly. But uh what is fun about
27:12 it, it's um our first first sales
27:18 um wasn't on Twitter and we didn't
27:20 launch yet. It was because I I um
27:25 subscribed to a list of Black Friday and
27:28 someone saw it. I don't know how. So
27:31 yeah, that's fun.
27:33 Okay. So what I just want to summarize.
27:36 So first you saw the idea, right? So you
27:38 saw the idea that there is this
27:40 algorithm called dream booth that takes
27:42 pictures in and then creates new
27:44 pictures and then you like the results
27:46 and you wanted to make a project um like
27:49 a small software as a service project
27:51 that other people can use right then uh
27:54 what you did uh because
27:58 correct me if I'm wrong that you found
28:00 an API that uses this algorithm and then
28:03 you built like your project around this
28:06 API Right.
28:08 Exactly. Yes.
28:09 Okay. And then uh so I guess this is
28:12 another service that you you used,
28:14 right? So you you needed to pay them.
28:17 Exactly. Yes.
28:18 Mhm. And uh so this is an
28:20 Yeah.
28:21 This is an API and it doesn't take care
28:24 of storing images and all that. So what
28:27 you needed to build was like all these
28:29 things like getting images um
28:33 from the API, saving them somewhere and
28:35 then sending to the customers, right?
28:38 Yes, exactly.
28:41 Okay. You said your first sale came from
28:43 even before you went live. So you put
28:45 the link somewhere.
28:47 Yes, there was a list of Black Friday
28:50 Black Friday deals. It was this week
28:53 that we launched. So, I just subscribed,
28:55 but I didn't imagine someone would see
28:58 it to be honest and uh well, yeah,
29:02 someone saw it.
29:04 Okay. And how do you do the lounge?
29:07 Uh I I talk about it on on Twitter and
29:11 uh I also use some personal media like
29:15 in on my personal Instagram or Facebook.
29:19 But I think mainly all all sales came
29:22 from um Twitter and also the Black
29:26 Friday sites because there was other
29:29 sale from this website.
29:32 Okay. So what did you do like how did
29:34 you announce this on Twitter? Did you
29:36 just say okay this is uh our new cool
29:39 project go check it out or
29:41 yeah something like that and uh yeah I
29:45 also uh displayed some picture of myself
29:48 uh saying so this was done using the
29:52 using anali and um
29:56 and um yes that's pretty it um maybe
30:00 there's some better way but I'm still
30:03 learning this job.
30:06 Okay. Yeah. I cannot think of a better
30:08 way probably. Uh that's the
30:12 And you I guess also rely on other
30:14 people sharing their pictures, right?
30:16 Sorry.
30:17 You also rely on other people sharing
30:19 the results.
30:20 Yes, exactly. Some people uh share the
30:23 results. Uh you were one of them. Thank
30:26 you.
30:27 And uh and yeah also I so it displayed
30:32 on the website so people other people
30:34 can have some example uh in order to see
30:38 the results.
30:40 Mhm.
30:40 And also if they want they can ask the
30:43 user is it really working? I don't know
30:45 but uh
30:47 yeah your results were pretty
30:48 impressive. uh for my pictures it didn't
30:51 work well but the reason for that is uh
30:53 because I just uh when I saw that you
30:55 launched this uh I just took my phone I
30:58 took a few selfies from different uh
31:01 backgrounds from different angles uh and
31:04 that was it but I guess you used a lot
31:07 of different images right so it wasn't
31:08 from one day
31:10 yes I remember when you tried you I
31:12 think you had a green shirt
31:15 on all your results you have a green
31:17 shirt and AI is not magic. I mean if you
31:20 send only picture where you are like
31:22 that
31:23 you will be like that on the results
31:26 that's uh
31:28 yeah but it's not magic.
31:31 So what uh was the main challenge here
31:34 for this project? So in the previous
31:36 project you said the main challenge was
31:38 reaching u the target audience the
31:40 crypto traders and it's not easy but
31:43 what was the main challenge here?
31:46 I think the main challenge was also
31:49 customer acquisition is very hard but at
31:52 least with this project we we made some
31:55 sales not enough to uh be ramen
31:58 profitable which is a a target very
32:02 famous when you are in in the king. Um
32:06 but um I think he has main main issue
32:11 was to reach people and also to um get
32:16 some uh not too high prices. Uh but at
32:21 the very beginning it was very difficult
32:23 because it cost I think um it was 15 per
32:30 um fine tuning.
32:32 Mhm.
32:33 So you add also our cost. So it was
32:37 difficult to to do some low prices and
32:42 uh also it's something that it's not
32:44 very useful. Uh I mean it's fun to have
32:47 a picture of yourself in
32:50 in AI but it can be useful. I know yeah
32:54 you can use it like for professional for
32:57 LinkedIn. I know some people use it for
33:00 Tinder but um but it's
33:02 it's a nice use case. So, somebody
33:04 actually uses it for Tinder, right?
33:07 So, that's what he told me. Yes.
33:10 Do you have uh his testimonial on the
33:13 website?
33:14 Sorry.
33:15 Do you have his testimonial on the
33:16 website? Like, okay. Like, I used this
33:19 Unreal Me Tinder and I found the love of
33:23 my life.
33:24 The love of my life. No,
33:27 it's be a great story, I guess.
33:29 Yeah. Exactly.
33:32 Okay. So I guess in both of these cases
33:34 reaching the target target audience was
33:36 the main problem.
33:38 Yes.
33:39 Is it always the case like you build
33:41 something and uh you cannot expect that
33:43 people will just come. You need to
33:46 proactively promote it.
33:48 You have to proactively Yeah. And this
33:51 is something that is u it's um you
33:56 really really see it when I see when I
33:59 made sales. it's uh every time when I um
34:03 talk about it that it doesn't happen
34:05 just like that. Um and um so yeah and
34:10 also another issue is the time of course
34:14 I was lucky for Enreal me because my
34:17 friend was still on a maternity leave so
34:20 she had time because um she was alone at
34:25 home and uh sometimes with the baby but
34:28 uh I know that sometimes she had some
34:32 times but um
34:33 sometimes babies sleep right?
34:35 Yes, exactly. And when you are alone I
34:37 guess you
34:39 do indie hacking
34:42 and um but yeah so having also
34:46 you think about a lot of features that
34:49 you can do but uh of course we are
34:52 limited in time.
34:54 Mhm. And what motivates you to do this?
34:57 Like why did you even start working on
34:59 indie hacking? because you wanted to
35:02 learn more outside of your job or what
35:05 was the main driver for you?
35:08 Yeah, I think I I enjoy uh the ideation
35:12 part like thinking about things that
35:16 could be done and I also like to create.
35:19 So, uh that's something that motivate
35:22 me. Yes. And this is very um I think
35:26 it's in addition to my work because I
35:29 like my work but um
35:32 not that you do every time the same at
35:34 your works because it's really not true
35:36 but uh this is kind of a personal
35:39 project and um I can do uh I can work on
35:43 whatever I want. So
35:45 I think it's really interesting.
35:48 Does it help at your like the skills
35:51 that you acquire through these projects
35:53 through through indie hacking? Do they
35:56 help you with your main job?
35:58 Uh actually yes because it's uh gave me
36:02 a new culture. Um I
36:07 before when I was working I use my free
36:10 time free time uh before in the king I
36:15 use my free time to do whatever things
36:18 and now this free time I use it also to
36:21 know more about AI about data and uh so
36:25 I guess it's profitable for
36:29 IBM of course and um
36:32 uh also I train myself to new skills and
36:36 um I think I understand better data
36:39 engineering now because even if it's not
36:42 really the part I'm working on I learn
36:46 GCP with this um some some part of it
36:50 yes
36:52 so you learn GCP you learn data
36:54 engineering you also learn marketing and
36:57 uh social media marketing in particular
37:00 what else did you learn
37:03 uh What do I learn? I learned that uh
37:06 even if you are a very good developer
37:08 without marketing you are nothing.
37:11 There is also some indie that say just
37:14 launch before building. So they they do
37:18 a landing page with a newsletter and
37:21 they see if people are interested
37:24 and if they do they build and I actually
37:27 met someone who did this and uh he
37:31 validate he validated his ID like that.
37:34 So yeah it really depends and um
37:39 uh I forgot sorry the question at the
37:41 beginning.
37:42 Yeah so the question was what kind of
37:43 new skills did you pick up? So GCP, data
37:46 engineering, social media marketing,
37:48 idea validation. What else?
37:51 I think that's also quite a lot.
37:53 That's already a lot, but maybe there is
37:55 more.
37:59 Probably probably
38:01 like you said, you already knew web
38:03 development to some extent, right? So
38:05 when you were building the landing
38:06 pages.
38:09 Yes. Um and also um like at first we I
38:15 build the landing page but that's that
38:17 was skill I already had and uh after
38:20 when we made a few sales we were able to
38:23 build some templates. So now uh for next
38:27 project u I can build faster because I
38:31 have a very nice template already done.
38:35 Um
38:37 I because the website I did before was
38:40 kind of quick to do but they are not
38:42 very awesome. At least I don't find them
38:45 beautiful, but uh it's the best I did
38:49 because also something I learned I think
38:52 I learned about um new tools
38:55 like using more Photoshop. Um it's a
39:00 yeah, it's a tool I use a lot, but uh
39:02 I'm still at the very beginning of
39:05 learning.
39:08 Did you ever need to use Photoshop at
39:10 IBM?
39:12 Uh sometimes I use it for IBM. Yes.
39:14 Okay. So I guess this is another useful
39:17 skill you picked up that you can use at
39:19 work, right?
39:20 Yeah. But I I I use it not so much for
39:23 client but some for internal project
39:26 sometimes. Yes.
39:28 Okay. And how do you balance your work
39:30 at IBM with indie hacking? Because it is
39:32 it difficult because I I guess uh like
39:36 at work like if you work from 9 to5 then
39:39 at the end you might be exhausted and
39:41 then uh you have other projects to work
39:44 on. So how how do you find energy to do
39:47 this?
39:48 I think it's like every patient. I mean
39:52 uh you if I told you I love uh horsing
39:57 horses. Do I said autation? I'm not sure
40:00 about the word. Is it correct?
40:02 I guess.
40:03 Yeah. If I told you I love to do uh
40:06 horses. Um
40:09 then you say okay wow that's a passion.
40:11 It's great
40:13 or I love dancing. I do uh few hours
40:17 every two days etc. Uh it's very common
40:21 to have hobbies like that. Uh mine is
40:24 building projects. So I don't see it as
40:27 exhausting. Uh for me it's like uh I'm
40:32 I'm motivated to work on it actually. So
40:35 it's not okay my work day is finished.
40:37 Oh, I have to work again. I don't see it
40:40 as a worksh
40:41 and I actually I think it's essential
40:44 like if you want to do Hindi uh in
40:47 addition to your work you have to be
40:51 uh passionated about it.
40:53 Okay. So that's your hobby right that's
40:56 the it gives you energy. So at the at
40:58 the end of the work at the end of the
41:00 working day you might be tired but you
41:03 start working on your side projects and
41:05 you get energy from this. Yes. And if I
41:09 don't, I just don't do the Yeah.
41:12 Because you don't have to, right?
41:15 Because Sorry.
41:15 You don't have to.
41:16 I don't have to. I don't uh Yeah, there
41:19 is.
41:20 Yeah. That's where the independent
41:23 u this indie part comes into place,
41:26 right? So, you don't uh you don't own
41:29 anything anyone, right? So you because
41:31 you don't have funding, you don't have
41:33 investors, then nobody is pushing you to
41:36 actually work except for only you.
41:39 I see.
41:40 I think it could be different if uh I
41:43 had a successful service used by a lot
41:46 of users. Uh probably there is some
41:48 client support and we had to
41:51 we could have to manage time, but this
41:53 is not our our case. So
41:57 we'll see later for that.
41:59 Okay. and I saw a tweet from you. So
42:01 there is actually it was a reply. So the
42:04 the tweet that you replied to was do you
42:06 have a list of mikraas ideas? And you
42:10 replied that of course there are many on
42:12 your list.
42:13 Um so maybe can you tell us first of all
42:16 what is a mikraas?
42:18 Mikra software as service right? What is
42:20 this? Is this what we discussed? Right.
42:22 So all these things that you built are
42:24 micro software services projects. Yeah,
42:28 I don't know if the term micro is uh
42:31 important or but yeah, I have a lot of
42:35 ideas. I have my notion list with a
42:37 to-do list, but uh of course I won't
42:41 build them all. But um yeah, what I have
42:45 as an idea is to
42:48 um
42:50 I I work on a project. If it works well,
42:53 that's cool. I can improve it. If it
42:55 doesn't, I I start a new one. So, as I
42:58 said, and now I'm working on the on some
43:02 Twitter tools um to uh make better
43:06 analytics of uh your data.
43:09 Um so, this is one I will launch. Uh
43:14 there will there is other on there are
43:17 other on my list. I won't tell not
43:21 because it's confidential but because uh
43:24 I don't know if I will launch one day
43:27 and but there is one actually I can tell
43:30 you about is a blog creation
43:35 uh it's called aboutstartup.io
43:39 And this is very new. I do the lunch
43:41 today. You will probably see a tweet.
43:44 And the idea of it is um I wanted to um
43:49 interview other people that do indie
43:52 hacking or that build some companies uh
43:57 or even if it's a small one. But uh in
44:01 order to inspire people and also say
44:04 there is not only successful people uh
44:07 it takes time and it's okay uh when you
44:10 start to do india king you shouldn't
44:13 think okay I will be
44:16 millionaire at the end of the year or
44:18 something like that I think this is not
44:20 a good um a good way to sing because
44:25 it's very hard and uh yes so I want to
44:28 share some story. And this is something
44:30 I wanted to do for a long time, so I
44:33 just started.
44:35 Okay, great. Looking forward to seeing
44:37 this. Uh, but this is a blog post,
44:39 right? This is a blog, right? So,
44:41 yeah, it's a website with a bunch of
44:43 articles.
44:45 It's not a software as a service thing.
44:48 Oh, no. Yes, exactly. I'm not.
44:51 So, how can you earn money with this or
44:55 it's more like a just fun project?
44:57 Project? I think it's it's fun project
44:59 but also uh there is some people there
45:03 are some people that earn money with
45:06 blogs. Um there is several way it's like
45:11 imagine you have a blog you talk about
45:14 cars a lot. Uh so you can find sponsor
45:19 I would say okay I'm a car can you write
45:21 an article about my car?
45:24 So that's a way of earning money. You
45:27 can also monetize um uh with ads uh or
45:32 also um with affiliation. That's several
45:37 ways. I see. Interesting. Well, you said
45:40 you don't want to talk about particular
45:42 ideas that you have on the list and
45:44 that's understandable. But uh maybe you
45:46 can tell us how these ideas ended up on
45:48 your on your list. Like how where do you
45:51 get ideas from?
45:53 Yeah. So sometimes I'm trying to do
45:55 something and I say oh but this doesn't
45:59 work well how can I do something else
46:03 exactly like cryptop I was on my
46:06 computer looking at chart say oh this
46:08 take me too much time how can I reduce
46:11 this time so I google it and I didn't
46:14 find any solution to fix my problem so I
46:19 said okay it doesn't exist I will build
46:23 because I have the skills also because
46:27 I mean if I don't like the the bread in
46:30 my city I I won't create my bread.
46:36 I see. So it mainly comes from your
46:40 frustrations or from the uh limits
46:43 limitations of other tools. So there is
46:46 a tool that solves a problem but it
46:48 doesn't solve it in a way that you want
46:50 and you see okay like there is it's
46:53 possible to make it better and you take
46:56 this idea down you take a note of this.
46:59 Yes exactly that's exactly what we did.
47:01 The exception is for Unrealme it was
47:04 really just because uh we saw other
47:09 competitors that validated the ID and
47:12 say okay maybe we can earn a few money
47:14 with it. So that was different.
47:17 Okay. So what are your plans? What do
47:19 you So you said you are about to launch
47:23 this about startup.io today, right?
47:26 Then you have a Twitter analytics tool.
47:30 What else uh should we expect from you
47:32 in the future or you don't know yet?
47:36 I don't tell us.
47:37 Okay.
47:38 I don't know yet. It depends. It
47:40 depends, you know. Um I also when I
47:44 because I I like to share my results and
47:48 not only hey I'm successful but also I
47:50 said you have to show uh failure you I
47:54 think I like to be transparent and um
47:58 doing this there is one person that
48:01 contacted me and say okay uh about
48:04 cryptop I have a crypto audience um can
48:09 you do a telegram for me when every time
48:13 I trade um my audience see what I bought
48:18 or sold and so this is the kind of
48:22 opportunity that you don't expect at
48:24 first but this happened.
48:26 Mhm.
48:28 Okay. Interesting. So you what you say
48:31 is you plan to work on your existing
48:34 projects a little bit and then maybe
48:37 there are some new ideas that you will
48:39 have and maybe you will
48:41 launch them too right
48:43 yes and it's I think it's very common
48:45 that you have an idea and then you start
48:48 to build it and you say okay maybe I can
48:51 do differently and so you change your
48:53 mind
48:54 and the way you do this so let's say you
48:57 have an idea on this list that you
48:59 haven't started working on yet. So, how
49:02 do you go from this idea on the list to
49:04 actually launching it? What are the
49:07 steps? I think I evalu uh first also I I
49:10 I talk with my friends and we evaluate
49:14 if there is really a need if there is a
49:17 lot of competitors for example then we
49:20 we don't want to build just to build um
49:25 again except maybe for analy but because
49:27 we could build it very quickly um so
49:30 yeah we evaluate and we say okay do I
49:33 need this yes
49:35 will other people uh will need it
49:38 probably. And do we have the skills to
49:42 do it? Yes. So, okay, we can build it.
49:46 What about actually?
49:48 Sorry.
49:49 Yeah, please go.
49:51 No, that's that's what happened also
49:53 with the Twitter tools because I so I
49:56 tweet a lot and I see that um u the
50:02 Twitter analytics tool is very bad. At
50:06 least I don't like it.
50:09 It's helpful but there is a lot of
50:11 information I can get from it. So I
50:14 wanted my own tool. I know some other
50:17 tool exist. Um but um they all have a
50:23 different offer and um
50:27 I think I offer something different at
50:30 least I I build it on my own way. Mhm.
50:35 See. Yeah. Interesting. And yeah, so
50:38 since you mentioned Twitter and you also
50:41 said, correct me if I'm wrong, that you
50:44 started your Twitter account in summer
50:47 last year, summer 20 uh 2022, right? And
50:51 now you recently tweeted that you have
50:54 10,000 followers.
50:56 So it means like you got 10,000
50:57 followers in half a year, right?
51:00 Yes, exactly.
51:01 That's a very impressive result. So, how
51:03 did you do this?
51:05 I think I started this in June and I had
51:09 11 followers because uh I had the
51:12 account for a few years but I didn't use
51:16 um Twitter before I I just I guess one
51:20 day I subscribed and never came back.
51:23 And uh yes, this summer I had an
51:25 interesting conversation with someone
51:28 who said uh who told me uh about
51:31 personal branding and also um because he
51:35 created some companies too. And he told
51:38 me if u you create one project and you
51:41 create an Instagram for this project
51:44 then you create another project you can
51:47 put in trash the audience that you build
51:49 for the first one. And I wanted a
51:52 continuity. Uh the common um common
51:55 things between all your project is you
51:58 actually so I say okay um that's true
52:02 and I want to show to people um I want
52:06 to share with people what I what I do.
52:09 So I do data I do um in the hacking. So
52:13 I'm talking about both and it seems uh
52:17 people like it. So
52:19 yeah, otherwise they wouldn't follow
52:20 you, right?
52:21 Sorry.
52:22 Otherwise they will would not follow you
52:25 if they didn't like it.
52:26 Or maybe they click
52:29 accidentally.
52:31 But
52:32 but yeah, accidentally maybe one or two
52:34 but not 10,000.
52:36 I hope so.
52:38 What do you think? Um people in your
52:41 posts like more posts about data science
52:43 or posts about indie hacking or
52:45 something else?
52:47 I think it works better with data sense
52:50 because um people can more identify to
52:54 it when I share like courses or some use
52:58 cases. I know uh I got I think I got
53:01 more interaction from it. Um but uh I
53:07 don't build my Twitter only
53:09 strategically. So and hiking is an
53:13 important part of my life and I want to
53:15 share about it. though I choose not to
53:18 uh go all in on data and to talk about
53:22 the two subjects.
53:24 And I see that there's a question from
53:26 Kevin. Um the question asks if there is
53:30 any way to connect with you. So um are
53:34 your DMs in Twitter open?
53:37 Uh yes you can. then we will have your
53:40 Twitter account. Um we will have the
53:42 link to your Twitter account in the
53:44 description and then you can just uh
53:46 contact and also you are in the data
53:50 talks club slack right? So that's
53:51 another way to contact you.
53:53 Yes I I had some times before uh
53:58 successfully connect because but it was
54:01 very personal was because of my computer
54:03 but at the end I reached it. Yeah. You
54:07 don't use Slack at IBM, do you?
54:09 Uh, yes, we do. And that's that was
54:11 exactly the the point. I thought I
54:13 couldn't I thought it was a conflict if
54:16 I use Slack for other uh not IBM spaces,
54:21 but actually it works. So
54:23 that's great.
54:24 Good. Because you recently posted uh you
54:28 made a post in general
54:31 saying happy new year, right? Something
54:32 like that.
54:33 Yes, I think so.
54:34 Yeah. So, thank you. Happy new year too.
54:39 Okay. And then um another question from
54:41 Kevin is if you know Peter Levelvels. Do
54:45 you know who Peter Levelvels is?
54:47 Uh yeah I know him but not personally. I
54:50 mean I saw his account. Yeah.
54:54 Okay. What does he do?
54:56 Oh he do uh he is an aspiration. He is
55:01 an India that built I think around 70
55:04 project and um a few of them became
55:08 successful and I think one of his first
55:12 s I am not sure if it's the first no
55:15 it's not the first successful I think he
55:19 he built one project that is called
55:21 interior eye sorry for the English
55:25 accent but it's a website where you can
55:30 generate buy a some new interior for
55:34 your
55:34 interior interior.io you said, right?
55:38 Uh I'm I'm not sure about the link.
55:40 Maybe you'll just send send us the link
55:42 later.
55:43 Yeah. And uh so yeah, you send a picture
55:47 of your apartment and uh it generates
55:50 new uh decorations.
55:52 Um and uh so he's the one I was talking
55:56 uh earlier. Uh I got the inspiration for
55:59 in real. He was the one I saw uh his
56:02 project was working and I say okay it
56:04 works for him. Why why not me? Why not
56:09 me? Why don't I try it? So I tried it.
56:13 Okay cool.
56:14 But I wasn't that suspectful of course
56:17 but because he has a big audience. He
56:20 was the first and he did it very well.
56:22 So,
56:22 but I guess also for
56:25 uh for Peter like maybe wasn't
56:27 successful from the first attempt.
56:28 Probably took a few trials before
56:31 something took off, right?
56:33 Yeah. Yes. He shared a list recently. I
56:37 think it was 70 projects that he did.
56:40 Mhm.
56:41 And I think he make a living of four of
56:44 them, maybe five, I don't know.
56:48 Okay. So if you shoot many arrows then
56:50 um a couple of them will hit the target
56:52 right?
56:53 If sorry
56:54 if you shoot a lot of arrows to your
56:57 target then a few of them probably will
57:00 hit it even if you're a bad archer.
57:02 Yeah I think the more you build the more
57:05 uh chances you have to be successful.
57:09 Do you have any book or other resource
57:13 um that you can recommend to the
57:14 listeners?
57:17 um about data there is a two words data
57:21 sense that I really love um because it's
57:26 a blog where they share a lot of use
57:28 case of data uh something I read really
57:31 frequently and um but I don't read much
57:36 so I don't have a lot of books yeah to
57:38 recommend
57:40 and I can if you want inspiration about
57:44 India king of course about startup.io is
57:47 very cool.
57:49 Okay. So that's the resource you
57:51 recommend to check um because I guess
57:54 for the when we will release this
57:58 recording as a podcast um about
58:01 startup.io will already be live. So we
58:04 will also include the link in the
58:05 description. So that's the resource you
58:08 should go to if you want to learn more
58:10 about indie hacking. Cool. Um, anything
58:14 else you wanted to talk about but we
58:16 forgot to mention?
58:19 Uh, I think we we talked about pretty
58:22 much everything.
58:24 Okay, then I guess we should be wrapping
58:27 up. So, thanks Pauline. Um, was pleasure
58:30 having you here. Um, finally like we
58:33 postponed the stream a couple of times.
58:36 Finally we met. Um, again had some
58:40 technical difficulties. So this time we
58:41 used Streamyard but yeah
58:44 the important thing yeah important thing
58:46 is we actually did this finally. So
58:49 thanks for joining us today. Thanks for
58:50 sharing your experience. Uh um as you
58:53 said it's very important to share the
58:55 experience even though some things
58:56 didn't work maybe in the way you
58:58 expected them to work but it's still
59:00 important to share this. So thanks for
