0:54 now I will stop sharing my screen.
0:59 And I will now open the document with
1:01 questions that we prepared for you.
1:04 [Music]
1:07 And
1:08 I think I'm ready. Are you ready?
1:10 Yeah, I'm good.
1:12 Okay. So, let's start. This week, we'll
1:15 talk about self-studying and continuous
1:17 learning in machine learning and
1:18 bioinformatics. We have a special guest
1:20 today, Aisha. Aisha is a self-taught
1:23 bioinformatician, machine learning
1:24 engineer and data scientist from
1:26 Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South
1:29 Africa. She graduated from machine
1:32 learning zoom camp that we have here in
1:33 data talks club and she studied Python
1:36 and basic de development um and she
1:40 maintains a blog on bionformmatics and
1:42 machine learning topics. Beyond touch is
1:44 interested in many other things such as
1:46 photography and digital art. So maybe if
1:48 you saw the picture we have for the uh
1:52 cover today like there is this spice
1:54 mushroom spice mushroom and this is what
1:57 we talked about. So this is something
1:58 Aisha drew. So welcome to our interview
2:01 today.
2:04 I'm glad to be able to speak on the
2:06 podcast and thank you for having me.
2:08 Yeah. Uh the questions for today's
2:10 interview were prepared by Johanna Byer.
2:12 Thanks Johanna as always for your help.
2:14 you are very helpful in preparing all
2:15 these questions and let's start. So
2:18 before we go into our main topic of
2:21 self-study and continuous learning in
2:23 machine learning bioinformatics let's
2:25 start with your your background. Can you
2:27 tell us about your career journey so
2:29 far?
2:30 Um my career journey I would say is like
2:33 just beginning still considering I'm
2:36 like I'm basically a student. I've just
2:38 uh I've been mostly um doing my studies
2:40 up to now. But like um I started
2:42 studying Python um quite a few years
2:46 ago. I don't remember how old I was. I
2:48 think I was like 12 or something or 11
2:50 maybe. Um and I've been study I did like
2:53 introductory Python and then I did like
2:54 JavaScript and HTML and CSS like the
2:57 standard I want to do coding what do I
2:59 do package. Um and then I discovered
3:02 like data science and bioinformatics and
3:04 I was like okay this is like a cool
3:06 field to go into and I started studying
3:09 that and I was also studying like
3:10 biology and chemistry and like the more
3:13 sciency fields and um then recently I
3:16 started going into more machine learning
3:17 and like actually focusing on trying to
3:19 build my career in machine learning. So
3:22 that is like my goal now is to like
3:24 establish myself in machine learning and
3:26 still be able to like do my
3:28 bioinformatics along with it if there's
3:31 like some way I can merge these two
3:34 different fields I've been doing. And
3:36 then scientific illustration is
3:38 something I want to like pursue on the
3:40 side maybe as like a second field or
3:43 something like that.
3:45 Scientific illustration what is that?
3:48 Um, scientific illustration is like
3:50 there are different types of scientific
3:52 illustration like the you I'm not sure
3:54 if you've seen those where they make
3:56 like infographics or like animations or
3:59 stuff explaining like scientific
4:00 concepts.
4:01 New York Times well New York Times is
4:03 different maybe there are not so many
4:05 not so much scientific but I think there
4:07 are seen I've seen there are like um
4:10 scientific illustrations published in
4:11 New York Times as well. So that's like
4:13 one of them
4:14 and um then also like just general
4:16 making um art to explain science
4:18 basically is how I describe it's like
4:20 explaining science through art in like a
4:23 visually engaging appealing manner for
4:25 like people maybe who are not so much
4:28 into science who just have like a
4:29 general interest in science like
4:31 explaining all the dejargonifying
4:33 science and explaining it in like a easy
4:36 nice manner is what I would consider
4:37 scientific illustration or art as a
4:40 whole.
4:42 I think we had a podcast episode um
4:45 maybe a year ago or sometime like that.
4:47 It was with me um and we talked about
4:50 visualizing machine learning
4:52 and we spent most of the time on that
4:55 interview discussing how exactly Mo
4:57 comes with uh his visualizations um
5:01 like how he goes from a concept to like
5:05 an illustration what is the process. So
5:07 probably it's related. Yeah, it's like a
5:10 similar thing.
5:11 Mhm.
5:12 Okay. And then you said you studied
5:15 Python. You started studying Python like
5:17 12 years ago or something like that.
5:19 Quite some time ago. And then you
5:20 also uh it wasn't that long ago. I was
5:23 like 12 myself. I was 12 years old.
5:26 Ah 12 months ago. Not 12 years ago.
5:29 No. No. Like it wasn't 12 months ago. I
5:32 was 12 years ago when I started studying
5:34 Python. I think it was like five or six
5:36 years ago.
5:38 I see. Okay, I see. So you're not like
5:40 uh you're what I'm trying to ask here is
5:43 you're not taking these classes as any
5:46 part of any formal education, right? So
5:48 you're just going there on the internet,
5:51 finding things there to study and you
5:53 just study them, right? Or how how does
5:55 it work? Like how do you learn all these
5:57 things?
5:58 Okay. Uh, so I wouldn't say I like just
6:00 go on the internet and just start
6:02 studying things like um I I try I'm a I
6:05 try not to be like randomly pursuing
6:07 everything I find interesting.
6:08 It's not formal education, right? It's
6:10 not like Yeah, it's self-study. But like
6:12 I'm
6:12 doing this at university.
6:14 I'm being homeschooled. So like I
6:16 haven't gone to any formal education
6:17 technically. I never went to school.
6:19 I've not gone to uni. I like technically
6:22 if I was going in school I would be
6:24 going to uni now. So I'm not going to
6:26 uni. I've not been to any school. So
6:28 like I everything I know I've either
6:30 like my mom used to teach me before that
6:32 or I've self-studied. So I've either
6:34 homeschooled or selftaught.
6:37 Interesting. I don't think I ever spoke
6:39 to anyone who was homeschooled. So how
6:42 how did it feel?
6:45 That's such a difficult question to ask
6:47 because like I don't know because you
6:48 don't know, right?
6:49 Yeah. I don't know what it would feel
6:50 like going to school because I've like
6:52 literally never gone to school. So
6:54 Mhm.
6:56 But it would be your mother or like just
6:59 teaching you some stuff and then
7:00 eventually maybe it was just you
7:03 studying things.
7:04 Yeah. Like obviously when I was a kid
7:06 then it was like my parents what I would
7:07 like to teach for like we'd study
7:10 whatever and like we never like followed
7:12 a curriculum or something. So I was like
7:14 um I whatever at that point like that's
7:17 why I started studying programming or
7:19 scientific stuff much earlier I think
7:21 than I would have gotten to at school
7:23 because like I I found it interesting so
7:25 that my mom would like gather resources
7:27 and let me learn it and teach me or
7:29 whatever. And then after that once I was
7:32 old enough I just started studying by
7:33 myself online with online resources and
7:36 stuff. So
7:39 interesting. Yeah. Well, when my kid is
7:42 sick and we need to do some
7:44 homeschooling too, I just never have
7:46 patience to actually sit with you and uh
7:50 explain all this stuff. So, your parents
7:52 must be very patient people.
7:54 Yes, my parents put up with a lot of
7:56 stuff.
7:57 Yeah, that's cool. Well, I guess you
7:59 have more flexibility this way, right?
8:01 So, like if you want to travel, you just
8:02 go and travel.
8:04 Yeah. Um even even not like I'm not not
8:07 like even if traveling and stuff just in
8:08 what I'm studying there's like so much
8:10 more flexibility than in school where
8:12 okay you're studying one thing and then
8:13 like you can't study everything you want
8:16 maybe at school because you have to
8:18 follow the school system and this way I
8:21 can like study things I I can pick and
8:23 choose what I want to study like if
8:25 there's something I already know then I
8:26 don't have to like go through again in
8:28 like I would have to in school
8:29 curriculum.
8:32 Yeah. Because what I wanted to ask you
8:34 next or the question we prepared is what
8:36 motivated you to take this approach and
8:38 I guess you kind of answered it already
8:40 because you have been doing
8:43 self-studying since forever right since
8:47 since school days.
8:48 Yeah. Um so maybe what is interesting is
8:51 how do you decide to learn what exactly
8:54 like there there are so many things on
8:55 the internet right so you open any I
8:58 don't know data science subreddit or I
9:00 don't know any data science community
9:02 and then you're immediately bombarded
9:04 with all these links all these new
9:06 things and then you feel okay like I
9:08 have to study all that and if I don't I
9:11 have this uh I fear I have this fear of
9:14 missing out so how do you approach this
9:16 systematically how do you not go crazy
9:18 what you need to do
9:20 what there is to study. So um as a
9:23 general like topic like okay I want to
9:25 study I don't know bioinformatics or
9:27 whatever um that I I think I started
9:30 following it like out of interest a bit
9:32 more because like I always wanted to do
9:34 like the sakuz scientific research and
9:37 stuff um but that hasn't always been
9:39 possible to like pursue that path. So
9:42 then I discovered that like there's
9:43 something more realistic within my reach
9:46 that I can do with like tech stuff and
9:48 online and with the resources I have
9:50 available and it's sort of like I still
9:53 get to do the cool sciency stuff but
9:55 it's like practical because I can do it.
9:58 So that is how I began studying it. And
10:01 I I I maybe um finding resources.
10:06 Um I don't know. I I've always like
10:09 maybe I did waste a bit too much time
10:11 doing like introductory Python courses
10:14 because I was like okay well I did this
10:15 course and I did that course and then
10:17 like I fed around for a while. But then
10:20 um it I think I've just gotten good at
10:22 like finding the good resources because
10:25 like you get you get the hang of it
10:26 after like doing it for a while of
10:28 finding out that these are like the best
10:30 resources. And then it helped that like
10:32 I had like a sort of guideline in my
10:35 mind of what I need to know. So I need
10:36 to know like this much of biology or
10:38 chemistry or whatever and my Python
10:40 skills need to be at this level. And
10:43 then for bioinformatics specifically, I
10:45 found this really cool pathway um made
10:47 by the open-source society university
10:51 where they make like these tracks and
10:53 stuff. So then I followed that and I
10:55 think generally like filtering out
10:57 information is a skill.
11:02 I think we lost you.
11:08 Or at least I don't hear you anymore.
11:16 Just want to check myself. One, two,
11:18 one, two.
11:21 Yeah, I think I'm still audible.
11:23 Actually, I think we lost your sound.
11:31 Yeah, no pressure.
11:48 I think I all hear something again.
12:15 So Aisha's make is glitching. This is
12:17 what she wrote me. So she should be back
12:20 soon hopefully.
12:24 Testing. Testing.
12:26 Yep. Works.
12:28 Okay. You got me now?
12:29 Yes.
12:31 Okay. Sorry about that.
12:33 Yeah, I don't remember what you were
12:35 talking about when it stopped. Well, you
12:37 were talking about different tracks uh
12:39 that there is this uh there are some
12:41 open curricula online and like you found
12:45 some tracks for bioinformatics and this
12:47 is what you studied.
12:48 Yeah. Um but I'll say like in general in
12:51 finding resources I think um spending a
12:54 lot of time online helps with that
12:56 because like you can start curating the
12:58 resources that you find and you're like
12:59 okay this is covering this skill set and
13:02 maybe this is not what I need right now
13:04 and it might be cool but maybe I can do
13:07 this at some later point and not now or
13:10 you can find like communities where
13:12 people have gathered resources like okay
13:14 to achieve this certain skill set this
13:16 is what you need to learn and then you
13:18 can either follow those specific
13:19 resources or you can find like alternate
13:21 resources but I think majorly what has
13:24 helped is having a like idea in my mind
13:26 of what skills I need. So like if I want
13:30 to pursue machine learning I need like a
13:32 basic introductory look at machine
13:34 learning and that's why I did the zoom
13:36 camp in the first place was because I
13:38 was like okay this seems like a good
13:39 resource to get my basics down and then
13:41 once I know a bit more about the field
13:43 then I can decide that okay what skills
13:45 do I need to develop further.
13:48 Yeah, I have so many questions based on
13:50 what you just said. So there are so many
13:53 interesting directions. So first of all
13:56 you said that you developed a feeling
14:00 you know when you look at resource you
14:01 know that it's good and I wonder how
14:04 does it work like how do you know let's
14:06 say you look at a zoom camp of course
14:07 zoom camp maybe this is a very good
14:09 example because it's good
14:12 of course I mean let's not take a zoom
14:14 camp like you take a resource right so
14:16 how do you know it's if it's good like
14:18 how do you
14:20 uh understand that
14:22 so um I've like there are a few things I
14:24 look at. The first I'll like skim the
14:26 syllabus or whatever and see if the
14:28 content that they're teaching is
14:30 something that I need right now if it's
14:32 like applicable to me right now. So like
14:34 obviously if I'm there's so much cool
14:36 stuff that I want to learn and I'm like
14:38 okay maybe knowing exactly how stars
14:41 explode in space is not something I know
14:42 right now. So obviously that's something
14:44 I just like throw out the window there.
14:47 But then say I pick up like a course on
14:49 machine learning and I will see that
14:52 okay the syllabus is good. it's teaching
14:54 me how to use a framework that I need to
14:56 know right now. So then I'll like watch
14:58 like the introductory videos and see
15:00 that okay does it feel like this course
15:02 is offering quality. Does it look like
15:04 something that is being talked in a good
15:07 way? Does it look like the people know
15:08 what they're talking about or am I going
15:10 to get ripped off here? Like that kind
15:12 of thing. Like just godging the general
15:14 quality of it. Like if you were to pick
15:16 up a book and you'd flip a few pages
15:19 around, read a bit, and you'd see like,
15:21 okay, does this look like something that
15:22 is quality or does it look like
15:24 somebody, I don't know, just wrote a
15:27 bunch of stuff that they don't know what
15:28 they're talking about and published it?
15:30 Because obviously on the internet, it's
15:32 like that YouTube stereotype where there
15:34 are people on YouTube who don't know
15:35 what they're talking about, but there
15:37 are lots of there's so much good
15:38 resources on YouTube as well. But like
15:40 you you you can get an idea for how much
15:43 the person knows what they're talking
15:45 about, how beneficial it might be if you
15:48 like skim through it a bit and like just
15:50 pick out bits and pieces and like listen
15:52 to them or whatever and then you can
15:54 decide that okay this up till now this
15:56 looks like something that's good and
15:57 then you can like commit to studying it
15:59 and then seeing how it is.
16:02 Do you mainly look at free resources or
16:04 you also consider paid courses? Um I try
16:08 and go for free where possible obviously
16:10 because like it's more affordable. Um
16:13 but if it's if it's like good resources
16:15 then I'm not like a worst to investing
16:18 in it because like okay this is
16:19 something that will benefit me or my
16:21 career down the lane then okay it's a
16:23 worthwhile investment but I will make
16:25 sure that if I'm investing in something
16:27 it is quality and it is worth it. It's
16:30 not like I would try to avoid investing
16:32 in something where I can learn with the
16:34 free resource resources even if it's
16:36 like a harder study or whatever
16:40 because scheming a paid course might be
16:42 more difficult, right? Because you don't
16:44 have access to the course usually maybe
16:48 some parts but you don't usually get the
16:51 access to the course to know if it's
16:52 good or not.
16:53 So you cannot.
16:54 So for for a paid resource I'd go more
16:56 like okay who's the author who published
16:58 it? Is there any free content that
17:00 they've put out or where somewhere where
17:02 I can like get a general idea for their
17:04 sort of content elsewhere like aside
17:07 from this one paid course so you can
17:08 like get a general profiling of who is
17:11 teaching the course before you like pay
17:13 for it to like get see if it's credible
17:15 or not see their credentials what work
17:17 they've done that kind of thing
17:21 then funny that you mentioned this um
17:25 information about how stars explode
17:26 because this is what I was just reading
17:28 the day. That's pretty cool stuff and
17:30 quite interesting.
17:31 Oh yeah.
17:32 But maybe like in this example, if you
17:34 study machine learning, then obviously
17:37 astronomy is not super relevant to that.
17:40 At least most of astronomy,
17:42 right? Uh so this is kind of a
17:43 no-brainer, right? So if you want to
17:45 learn about linear regression, you know
17:47 that how stars explode is
17:49 it's not going to help you.
17:51 Yeah. But when it comes to machine
17:54 learning, there are many things like for
17:55 example when I was studying machine
17:57 learning, I thought that support vector
17:58 machines are super important to
18:00 understand and also because um I was
18:03 taking a machine learning class at the
18:04 university and that at the university
18:06 the teacher was one of the
18:09 like he was doing a lot of research in
18:11 supporting machines. So I thought that
18:13 it's very important to really understand
18:14 these things well. But when I started
18:16 working I understood that nobody really
18:18 cares about them.
18:20 vectors machines are not really useful
18:21 anymore. So how do you understand that
18:25 like how do you understand these things
18:26 that um okay astronomy is not relevant
18:29 but when it comes to machine learning
18:31 there are some topics that are perhaps
18:32 more relevant some are less relevant
18:34 so how do you understand which direction
18:36 to go
18:37 I think this one this one is just
18:40 something like you do it and then
18:42 realize okay it wasn't that needed like
18:44 I spent a lot of time doing a data
18:46 science um course and that had a lot of
18:48 like data visualization and then also
18:50 had like data cleaning and everything
18:52 and at that point I was like okay maybe
18:54 this is not the direction I want to go
18:56 in so it's not that important as what I
18:58 was like I was doing it for machine
19:00 learning or data science more so seeing
19:03 how the data is clean or maybe good
19:05 knowledge to have but maybe not as
19:07 relevant as what I wanted to do then so
19:10 okay I did it and maybe it would come in
19:11 handy later but at the time it was not
19:13 what I was looking for so I think that's
19:15 just something you have to like you
19:17 figure out after the fact that you've
19:19 studied that okay this was not something
19:21 as relevant like because there's no way
19:23 you'd know that without studying it.
19:25 silver bullet. Okay. So, I thought maybe
19:27 you'll just uh tell me, okay, do that,
19:29 that, and then you'll know what is
19:31 really.
19:32 No, unless unless maybe somebody can
19:34 figure out some spells, then please
19:35 share with me.
19:37 Well, I guess in this case, um,
19:40 community is helpful, right? Because you
19:42 can always ask people what you went
19:44 through
19:44 and like you could I think like to some
19:46 degree maybe it is you can like get an
19:48 idea by doing your own research or like
19:51 figuring finding people more in the
19:53 field and like getting their if they
19:55 have done like interviews or question
19:56 answers whatever you could like ask them
19:58 or communities could be helpful but I
20:01 think to some degree it's unavoidable
20:03 that you end up studying something and
20:04 they're like okay maybe it wasn't that
20:06 important
20:07 at least in my
20:11 M
20:12 sorry I interrupted you.
20:13 No
20:16 um I I just wanted to say that while
20:18 doing my masters and also my bachelor I
20:21 also studied a lot of stuff that is not
20:23 relevant. So maybe if I was doing
20:25 self-study
20:26 instead
20:28 then things would have
20:31 been different right? So maybe I would
20:32 have actually spent more time on
20:34 studying things that are relevant not
20:36 because what teachers thought
20:38 what the teachers think is relevant and
20:39 like um there was somebody who mentioned
20:41 that they was studying computer science
20:43 and they said that for the first two
20:44 years of their curriculum they don't
20:46 touch computer science at all and they
20:48 must learn English and maths and
20:50 chemistry. So, like it's it's funny how
20:52 the school system works. Like why must
20:54 you study chemistry in your university
20:56 when you're majoring for computer
20:58 science? Like okay, that's one thing to
21:00 have a basic knowledge of it and it's
21:02 one thing that you're studying it in
21:04 university when you're trying to study
21:06 computer science whereas if you're like
21:08 you could just focus on computer science
21:10 and learn whatever is necessary and if
21:12 there are any gaps in your knowledge you
21:14 can also like go back and study later.
21:15 It's not like if you didn't study
21:17 chemistry in your first year, but then
21:18 you need it in your fourth year. It's
21:19 the end of the world.
21:21 Yeah, indeed. Well, I did not have that
21:24 when I was studying computer science.
21:27 Well, we had
21:28 I would say that that would also depend
21:30 on like where you're studying, but like
21:31 I'm just giving example.
21:32 We did have chemistry, but later like on
21:34 third grade, which is not really clear
21:36 why.
21:37 Uh I mean I had fun. I like chemistry at
21:40 school and then at university I also
21:41 kind of enjoyed it
21:43 but it's not something I really need to
21:45 know.
21:46 Yeah.
21:47 Apart from having pleasure in studying
21:49 this
21:50 no other application.
21:54 Yeah. But we did spend a lot of time
21:56 studying math and while fun like I
21:59 enjoyed like solving all these uh
22:02 equations and all these things like
22:05 again at my work as a data scientist.
22:08 Yeah,
22:08 most of these things aren't really
22:09 needed. So,
22:11 yeah, it's like one thing that um you
22:13 have you study something because you
22:14 find it interesting or you want to go
22:16 into like a research field or something,
22:18 so you studied it. But I think in like a
22:20 day-to-day application, you're you're
22:22 hardly going to need a lot of this kind
22:25 of stuff. And if you need it, again, you
22:27 can just like say you want to you you're
22:30 joining a you're pursuing a career path
22:32 and you're like, okay, this is needed.
22:34 So you can study it then instead of like
22:36 wasting all of your time studying it
22:38 where you could be building up a main
22:39 skill instead.
22:42 Yeah. And how how do you approach this?
22:44 How do you approach learning? Do you
22:46 focus on building projects? You focus on
22:49 learning theory first or how how does it
22:51 work for you in general?
22:53 Um
22:55 I like I think a balance of both is
22:58 needed. Um because obviously without
23:00 make building projects it's like there's
23:02 always that aspect to just theory which
23:04 is lacking because like you could know
23:06 something very well in theory but in
23:08 practice it you're like your knowledge
23:10 will end up falling short you run into
23:12 issues which you wouldn't have known in
23:14 how to solve with just the theory but um
23:17 I think also learning new things in the
23:20 theory is important like building new
23:22 skills or advancing your skill set
23:24 especially in something like tech like
23:26 if you're to build more projects in like
23:29 a particular field, but then you're not
23:31 learning new skills. And then at some
23:33 point, you're going to be like, "Okay,
23:34 these skills that I have are outdated."
23:36 And I spend all my time building a bunch
23:38 of projects with a skill that's now
23:40 falling out of the market.
23:43 And like I like learning more by
23:45 building projects as well as like I like
23:47 reading and stuff. So I I'll just read a
23:50 bunch about things and then I'll go and
23:51 try to build a project and I'm like okay
23:53 I did half of the things I learned
23:55 weren't needed and half of the things I
23:57 needed to build the project I didn't
23:58 know. So then you hit the Google.
24:01 So I think like a balance of both is a
24:04 good way to go. So like you you covered
24:06 on both fronts.
24:09 Yeah. I'm a big fan of uh the projects
24:11 approach and then I think I neglect
24:13 theory and then it's not the ideal case.
24:18 Maybe. Yeah, like it should be about
24:19 like you said.
24:20 Yeah, but to some degree projects always
24:23 a bit more interesting because you've
24:24 like got problem solving or whatever. So
24:26 I think that that the projects have a
24:28 bigger appeal at some point.
24:30 But I'm wondering for you how do you
24:32 decide what to build? Like if you want
24:35 to build a project then you probably
24:37 there is a skill you want to master and
24:39 then how do you decide that to master
24:42 this skill I want to build this project
24:44 that should do this this and that. How
24:46 does it work for you?
24:48 Um, I don't know. I just I I I think I
24:52 think of ideas first and then I'm like,
24:54 "Okay, this would be a good way to use
24:56 these skills." Like um I like I like
25:00 surfing. I like just surfing on the
25:01 internet and finding like for for the
25:03 data and stuff. I like just finding cool
25:05 data and I'm like, "Okay, what can I do
25:07 with this data?" Because I want to use
25:09 this data because the data is
25:10 interesting. And I'm like, okay, maybe
25:12 this would be something I want to like,
25:14 I don't know, get better at pandas or
25:16 something as a random example. And I'm
25:18 like, okay, I could use this data to
25:20 build something with this framework. I'm
25:23 like, okay, let's just do it. Like there
25:25 isn't a lot of reasoning behind my
25:27 project sometimes beyond it's cool,
25:28 let's do it.
25:31 So, I like going on those um data set
25:33 searches and just typing keywords which
25:35 like I'm interested in and then just
25:37 seeing what comes up and picking random
25:39 stuff that is cool. Yeah, let's say if
25:41 you're interested in astronomy and
25:43 exploding stars, you can go to Kaggle or
25:45 whatever data set
25:48 website and then you can just look for
25:50 astronomical stuff and then
25:51 okay, there's an interesting data set.
25:53 Let's see what I can
25:54 see what we can do with it. Yeah, like
25:57 um I another way I found of finding cool
25:59 data is like you know they publish the
26:01 research papers on random on like
26:03 science scientific stuff and a lot of
26:06 them they publish the data with it. So
26:08 it's not very clean data a lot of the
26:09 time because it's not like meant to be
26:11 used for data stuff. But if you like
26:13 clean up the data, it is you can make
26:15 like it's a cool way of finding data
26:17 that's like linked to like a study or
26:19 something and then you can see like okay
26:21 what else can be done with this data?
26:23 Can I like make something cool using
26:25 this data in a different way maybe?
26:29 So I like sorry please. I like just
26:32 going to like studies that I read
26:33 because I like I like reading scientific
26:36 papers just for the fun of it. So then I
26:38 bookmark the studies which are cool and
26:40 then just see what I can do with the
26:41 data in my free time.
26:43 How do you find these papers papers that
26:45 you want to read? Um mostly it's like I
26:49 just if I have like some sort of
26:50 question like I was wondering like um I
26:53 don't know I'm falling short on examples
26:55 but like I spent a lot of time reading
26:57 about horse color genetics because I was
26:59 like okay so if the horses have this
27:01 colors and how does their color genetics
27:03 work and then I was like okay so how
27:05 does the humanin and feminin
27:07 pigmentation work and I just fall in
27:08 like a Google rabbit hole until I find
27:11 cool research papers about it.
27:15 I don't typically do this every day, but
27:17 I remember when I was preparing for my
27:19 master thesis when I was writing it and
27:22 of course I needed to do some
27:25 research to understand what was done
27:27 before that uh before my work uh what I
27:31 can base my my work on
27:34 I found the Google Scholar very useful.
27:36 Yeah.
27:39 Yeah. You use it do you? Yeah, I I use
27:42 Google Scholar, but often I just go on
27:44 like the main Google and I just search
27:46 and like there's like the they just put
27:48 like research article or article as a
27:51 keyword and then you can get like um
27:53 there's like PubMed um nature articles
27:57 um quite a few I'm forgetting the names
27:58 now but like there quite a few which are
28:00 like free publications that allow you to
28:02 read the entire things without paying
28:04 for it.
28:07 Yeah, that's
28:08 it's good for like when I'm just sitting
28:10 free and I like I just end up spending
28:12 like hours on Google wasting my time
28:14 reading absolutely random stuff but
28:17 sometimes the data can come from it
28:18 which is useful.
28:21 Yeah, I remember one of the most useful
28:23 feature of Google Scholar was this
28:24 citation graph.
28:26 So you you know which what are the
28:28 impactful papers that this particular
28:31 paper sites.
28:32 Yeah. Yeah.
28:32 So then you can kind of go back
28:34 in time and see
28:35 and you can also see what paper cited
28:37 this paper. So you can pursue
28:39 that then you have like it's you have
28:41 this both directions right you can go to
28:43 the past and see what was done before
28:44 and then what kind of work was based on
28:46 this paper.
28:47 Yeah.
28:48 And then um
28:50 I remember also spending a lot of time
28:52 on that but I kind of had to uh to do
28:55 this because I needed to
28:58 like one of the chapters in my thesis
29:00 was state-of-the-art. m
29:02 uh research. I mean, so that was a part
29:05 of the thesis.
29:07 Um, but I can understand how fun it
29:10 could be like when you have a topic that
29:11 you're interested in and just go there
29:13 and
29:14 explore.
29:16 And uh yeah, I'm really curious now to
29:19 talk about your experience with uh our
29:22 course machine learning zoom camp.
29:24 Mhm.
29:25 How how did you find it? Uh like why did
29:28 it attract you? Why did you decide that
29:30 this is actually a good course?
29:32 Um, mostly because it was fast. Like it
29:35 was like four months so it's brief
29:37 because like I don't I I get bored. So I
29:39 didn't want to do something that was
29:40 very long. I'm like okay four months
29:42 it's fine. I can do it. And also it
29:44 mentioned like three
29:45 it's a lot of time. Four months is a lot
29:47 of time. Many things can happen in four
29:49 months.
29:50 Yeah. But it's like not it's not like a
29:52 huge long one year long. You got to
29:54 study for one year to get things done.
29:55 Four year degree.
29:57 Yeah. like I'm already studying my
29:59 bioinformatics has been going on for
30:00 like three or four years. So I wanted
30:02 something that's not going on for that
30:03 long. I wanted something like okay just
30:05 quick be quick about like don't spend
30:06 years and I thought that was like a good
30:09 way to like break into machine learning
30:12 like it's uh it's going to offer me like
30:14 a good comprehensive look at the
30:15 different aspects of it. Um this I got
30:18 from like reading your guys syllabus and
30:19 everything. And then I also saw that I
30:21 mentioned three projects and like weekly
30:24 small projects. So I thought that maybe
30:26 it's more project oriented. So that
30:27 would be fun because I didn't want to
30:28 like do too much theory. So mainly the
30:30 things that was like okay it's not that
30:32 long and it has projects. So I was like
30:34 okay let's give this a try. It should be
30:36 interesting.
30:38 You remember where you found it like on
30:40 Reddit or on social media somewhere.
30:43 Um first my mom mentioned it to me. I'm
30:46 not sure where she found it. I think she
30:47 follows the uh podcast the uh newsletter
30:51 or something and then I saw it and then
30:53 I saw it after that on LinkedIn. So I
30:55 was like, "Okay, I'm going to check this
30:56 out."
30:58 Is your mom listening to us talking
31:00 right now?
31:01 I'm not sure. She might be.
31:04 Okay. Well, tell her hi.
31:08 Anyways, um we were talking about
31:10 projects, right? And since you mentioned
31:13 uh and this is what I wanted to talk to
31:14 you about too. So in zoom camp we have
31:16 these three projects and I wanted to
31:19 talk to you like to understand how
31:20 exactly you approached your approach
31:24 what was your approach when it come when
31:26 it came to selecting projects uh how did
31:29 you decide what to do there like was it
31:31 also the data set first approach or how
31:33 did you go about that
31:35 yeah I think it was pretty much data set
31:36 first approach um except for the second
31:38 like the first capstone project that I
31:40 was doing the competition the kegle
31:42 competition for the kitchen war thingy
31:44 um and And then I I ran out of time to
31:46 build a separate one for the capstone.
31:48 So I used the same project in both
31:50 places. Um but the first project I did
31:53 like the midterm was about predicting
31:56 the toxicity of frogs based on their
31:59 color. Um so initially I was going to
32:02 make something I was like wanting to
32:04 find something cool because I didn't
32:06 want to do like the economic or
32:07 political the like property and price
32:10 data because that was boring. I don't
32:12 want to do it. Um, so I think I went I
32:15 don't remember there was like one
32:16 website either was a Google data set
32:18 search or some other website and I just
32:20 like searched like poison or something
32:23 like that. I initially want to do like I
32:25 want to do like um the most toxic
32:28 poisons or something like that. But then
32:30 I found this one where they um they did
32:31 an entire study
32:34 about how a species of frog's color
32:36 indicates it toxicity like its
32:37 brightness and everything. So I was like
32:39 okay well what if I make a model that
32:41 can if you input the data it can predict
32:43 the um species of the frog instead and
32:47 like its toxicity. So that's what I
32:49 built then. So I built a model that like
32:52 it takes the values um the values had to
32:54 be given in like the accurate form that
32:56 the study measured them in. So it wasn't
32:58 like practical probably but then it
33:01 would just predict how toxic that frog
33:02 species would be. So I just went on like
33:05 data set search and googled. And then I
33:07 think the next one I did was like a
33:09 landscape recognition. So that also I
33:11 just like okay I went on kegle. I wanted
33:14 for that one I wanted to do something
33:15 with like the image um recognition. So I
33:17 just went on kegle and I went open the
33:20 image recognition data sets and I saw
33:22 like a landscape classifier and I didn't
33:24 have too much time uh that time around.
33:26 So I just picked like a easier one and
33:28 went for the landscape classifier.
33:32 See well this one about frog toxicity is
33:35 really interesting. So I guess this is
33:37 one of the things that were interesting
33:39 for you back then, right? And then you
33:40 decided to find something.
33:43 Yeah, I actually wasn't even looking for
33:45 anything to do with frogs. I was looking
33:46 for something to do with poison because
33:48 like I'd been reading about poison
33:49 recently and I was like, "Okay, this is
33:50 cool. Let's do something poisonous." And
33:52 then I saw the frog one and then I did
33:54 my research. I read the research papers
33:56 and then I went and I read about that
33:57 fish is a frog and I was like, "Okay,
33:59 this is way cooler. We're doing this."
34:02 I kind of want to ask you more about
34:04 like how did you even
34:08 come across uh you know this poison
34:10 topic why because like the part of
34:13 self-studying I guess you you said you
34:15 spent a lot of time just doing random
34:17 stuff on the internet reading things. So
34:19 I'm really curious like how exactly it
34:21 happened. Did you even realize that okay
34:24 now you're all of a sudden interested in
34:27 uh poisons?
34:28 No, I honestly didn't. I keep I keep
34:31 like finding random things that are
34:32 interesting and then I just spend a lot
34:34 of time googling them until I'm bored
34:35 with them and then I never think about
34:37 them again. So poison is just one of
34:39 those I was like okay this is
34:40 interesting let's read about it but then
34:42 like it's not like a lasting interest.
34:45 See I see. Do you somehow structure all
34:48 these things like all these topics uh I
34:51 don't know poison then call like you
34:54 said horse genetics and all the other
34:57 things um like or just you keep
34:59 everything in your mind like in your
35:03 in your brain how does it work?
35:04 Yeah that that these are mostly just
35:06 like I'm free I have free time so like I
35:08 just do random stuff but none of these
35:10 are like structured it's just like okay
35:11 whatever interesting me at the moment I
35:13 might go and read about it. It's it's
35:15 like if I have free time or if I like
35:18 can push my time around then I'll just
35:19 squeeze them in anywhere I can but it's
35:21 not like something I like dedicate time
35:24 to reading about or anything. They're
35:25 like very unstructured.
35:27 Okay. So you I don't know wake up eat
35:30 your breakfast and then you have some
35:31 free time and then okay what I'm going
35:33 to read about today uh let's read about
35:36 frog poison. It's more like I've been
35:39 thinking about this for the past one
35:41 week, so I'm still reading about it and
35:42 I'm like, "Okay, well, next topic,
35:44 Chuck, I'm bored of frogs."
35:46 Okay, now let's read about horse
35:48 genetics, right?
35:49 Yeah. I just
35:52 Is it related to your interest in
35:54 bioinformatics in any way?
35:56 Um, bioinformatics is more born from my
35:59 general like I was at that time very
36:01 much obsessed. I wanted to be a
36:02 researcher at any rate. I don't want to
36:04 be anymore. But like at that point I was
36:06 like biology and chemistry research is
36:08 all I ever want to do in life. And then
36:11 obviously that was not possible at the
36:12 time because like I I didn't have the
36:14 resources Ible to like pursue that. And
36:17 that's probably a good thing because now
36:18 I'm not so sure if I want to do that.
36:20 But then at that point I was like okay
36:22 what else can I do that is related to
36:24 this? And then I discovered that
36:25 bioinformatics is an entire field which
36:27 is like the closest I can come to
36:29 combining what I can do and what at the
36:32 time I really wanted to do. So I was
36:34 like okay this is like a nice mesh of my
36:37 like obsession at the time and what I
36:40 can actually do. And then I was like
36:41 okay well I I really want to do this
36:43 like long term. So bioinformatics was
36:46 like that like one of the things that
36:48 just kind of stuck around one of these
36:50 obsessions that just stuck around.
36:54 And uh I'm really curious about like so
36:58 for example you said you wanted to do
37:01 research and then you studied but then
37:03 you realized you don't want to do
37:04 research but how do you stay motivated
37:08 when learning by yourself because I
37:10 imagine uh for me at least I quite often
37:14 need an ex like external push coming
37:16 from somewhere
37:18 to when I'm not motivated to actually
37:21 keep learning because If I don't do this
37:23 then I just um I don't know not do
37:27 anything.
37:29 So how how do you
37:31 keep yourself motivated when you learn
37:33 by yourself and you don't have this
37:34 external push then all your motivation
37:36 is coming from from you? Like how do you
37:39 do this?
37:40 Um honestly I'm not really sure. I think
37:44 I think I like uh I I work better when
37:47 there's like a deadline. So when I'm
37:49 like not demotivated, I just set up
37:52 like, okay, I have to finish this at
37:53 this point. So then I know like, okay,
37:55 there's a deadline yourself.
37:57 I set the deadline myself. Yeah. I think
37:59 to some degree being homeschooled might
38:01 have helped with this. Like I've never
38:02 had much of a external factor to like
38:05 keep me going. So being like, okay,
38:07 well, you got to do this at some point.
38:09 So just like pick a date and then that
38:11 that date cannot move. So even if I have
38:13 to stay up till like 2:00 a.m., I have
38:15 to finish it because of the deadline. So
38:17 it's like okay I just set my deadlines
38:19 and then like try to plan them as best
38:21 as I can and unless like something very
38:23 big came up the deadlines do not move.
38:25 So if I've been lazy one week I can't
38:27 say okay I'm going to push the deadline
38:29 one week because I didn't do anything.
38:31 I'll just have to do it then. So I think
38:33 that's the like oh goodness the
38:35 deadline's almost here is my motivation.
38:40 Yeah that's a lot of that requires a lot
38:42 of discipline because if you set
38:43 deadlines yourself then
38:45 Yeah. Yeah, like
38:48 that's
38:50 that's really cool like
38:53 and when you you have a deadline and you
38:57 know okay I have to do this
38:59 but then since this deadline is not kind
39:02 of real I'm still trying to understand
39:05 like it probably wouldn't work for me
39:07 maybe I don't know
39:08 I don't know I mean I I think I think
39:11 like at some point you it's like I'll
39:13 write my deadlines and I'll I have a
39:15 sticky note on my computer like a
39:17 digital one obviously and I just like
39:19 write in big bold that and to the point
39:22 where it annoys me and like I cannot
39:23 remove it until I finished it. So it's
39:25 mostly just like bullying my brain into
39:27 like okay you just have to do this now
39:29 stop being lazy. So like I I'm not like
39:31 I don't I don't think I'm very organized
39:33 with my time. I should be better at it.
39:36 So sometimes I like will waste an entire
39:38 week doing nothing much but then I'm
39:40 like okay well let's not let's not mess
39:43 up this one deadline. is just stop
39:45 messing around and do the work. So I
39:47 think with its ups and downs like I get
39:49 by I won't say I'm the most organized or
39:51 most uh very selfisiplined person but
39:55 like it works for me so it's fine. I get
39:57 the work done eventually. So it also
39:59 helps that I like switch between a lot
40:01 of different things. So if I'm bored of
40:03 one thing and I'm sick of doing it then
40:05 I can just switch the next thing. I like
40:07 run things in parallel so I can like I
40:09 have a escape like okay I'm sick and
40:11 tired of doing data science. Let's go
40:13 illustrate something instead.
40:16 See? Yeah, that's cool. Mushroom is the
40:19 mushroom is really cool.
40:22 And uh yeah,
40:25 I
40:28 am just curious. Uh so forgot what I
40:32 wanted to ask. So let me just uh um
40:34 yeah, it was about zoom camp. So in the
40:38 zoom camp in machine learning zoom camp,
40:40 we had some deadlines. I guess for you
40:41 it was helpful, right? So that's the
40:43 deadlines were external and
40:47 well at least for me that would be much
40:49 much more helpful than the deadlines I
40:51 would set for myself to
40:53 yeah the deadlines were helpful like um
40:55 at some point I was ignoring the midterm
40:58 project because I didn't want to do it.
41:00 I was bored and I was like studying
41:02 other stuff and then it was like I think
41:04 I only began it like in the second week.
41:06 I was like, "Okay, I should do this now
41:08 because I'm going to run off time." And
41:09 I did run off time because I got stuck
41:11 and then I finished it. I think I
41:13 submitted it like the Sunday before
41:15 after I'd been I like I got up early the
41:18 Sunday and I'm sitting working on the
41:19 project the entire Sunday and like I was
41:21 like, "Okay, maybe I shouldn't have
41:23 ignored this for all the first week."
41:24 But like having the deadline, I was
41:25 like, "Okay, I got to get this done."
41:27 Like I might have skipped on it
41:28 otherwise, but like I was, "Okay, I got
41:30 to like I want to stay on the
41:31 leaderboard. I can't skip this project."
41:35 And then while you were procrastinating,
41:38 you were reading. Procrastinating I mean
41:40 taking some time off the course.
41:42 You can call it procrastination. It's
41:44 fine.
41:46 You were probably about poison and
41:48 toxicity of frogs, right?
41:50 No, I think I was making scientific
41:52 illustrations or something. I can't
41:53 remember. I I was like convincing my
41:55 brain that this is productive too, you
41:56 know, just the wrong kind of
41:58 productivity.
42:02 And uh in general, how do you well, you
42:05 said that you use the sticky notes to I
42:08 think you said bully your brain into
42:12 doing stuff.
42:14 But when it comes to actually studying
42:16 like taking notes and uh keeping your
42:20 projects organized, do you have any
42:22 system for that?
42:24 Um like any time tracking tools, goal
42:26 setting? No, I don't take notes because
42:29 I forget to read them and I forget to
42:32 pay attention if I'm making notes. So,
42:34 notes are like I never use them. They
42:36 never help me. So, if I do get if I like
42:38 forget things, I just rewatch it or
42:40 Google it instead because notes have
42:42 never worked for me. And um as far as
42:45 like time tracking tools and stuff go,
42:46 no, I don't use them. It's just like,
42:48 okay, I have the deadline, but before
42:50 the deadline, I just mess around and do
42:51 whatever. As long as the work gets done
42:53 by the deadline, I don't care what my
42:55 daily schedule looks like. So like some
42:57 days I will do a bunch of stuff in the
42:59 day and then some days I just do one
43:00 thing in the day like focus on one
43:02 thing. So it's like whatever my mood is
43:04 for that day, whatever I'm up to doing,
43:08 but I don't really use like any
43:10 structural tools or anything.
43:13 Yeah, that's interesting that you
43:14 mentioned notes because for me notes is
43:16 the only thing that actually works if I
43:19 want to retain any information.
43:21 So it's funny how everyone is different,
43:24 right?
43:24 Yeah. Like I tried taking notes because
43:26 everyone's like notes are your key to
43:28 success and if you don't take notes you
43:29 never like learn properly. So I was like
43:31 okay well I got to take notes now and I
43:34 couldn't I would forget to pay attention
43:35 when I'm listening so that I would end
43:37 up like listening to the entire lecture
43:39 and I heard not a word and I would
43:41 forget them anyway. I wouldn't ever read
43:43 my notes. I would forget what the notes
43:45 mean. So notes just never worked for me.
43:50 Are there any drawbacks for stealth
43:52 studying? So let's say we compare uh a
43:55 zoom camp which where deadlines are
43:58 let's say external they are forced to
44:02 onto you
44:03 versus self-studying when you find
44:05 material
44:07 online and you take this you learn it uh
44:10 at your own pace.
44:11 So what are the some of the drawbacks in
44:14 this approach when it's completely
44:16 self-studying completely based on your
44:17 own motivation and discipline?
44:20 Um I think one of the drawbacks could be
44:23 the same motivation discipline thing
44:25 that's like it's easier to not fulfill
44:28 deadlines when you are the one setting
44:29 them and nobody else is like responsible
44:32 for them and also I think it can be a
44:36 bit harder to make sure you are learning
44:39 the correct things on your own like you
44:41 could end up wasting time or resources
44:43 studying something that down the line
44:45 you're like okay I shouldn't have done
44:47 that whereas if you're following a
44:49 course or like a system somebody else
44:51 made you're like okay these are people
44:52 in the industry obviously they know what
44:54 is more beneficial to study at a given
44:56 time. So like there having the resources
44:59 compiled is obviously a lot easier and
45:02 maybe to some degree more efficient like
45:05 there's a a higher chance of making a
45:07 mistake when you're doing it yourself
45:08 because before you studying you don't
45:10 know anything about that thing and then
45:12 afterwards you can be like okay well
45:14 hindsight 2020 I shouldn't have done
45:16 that but um
45:19 obviously at this point because I am
45:21 doing all the self-study I think its
45:23 benefits outweigh this like the freedom
45:26 you get and the how much more it works
45:28 for me personally. But obviously it may
45:30 not be for everybody and like there are
45:32 these things which are maybe better in
45:35 like following a structure structured
45:37 study program.
45:40 Do you find do you find study groups
45:42 helpful for you or you prefer doing
45:45 things yourself?
45:45 Yeah, I prefer doing things myself. I
45:47 don't like study groups. I don't like um
45:50 I'm not very much a social person. I
45:52 don't like doing things with others. I'm
45:53 fine on my own. But I know for others
45:56 they're like vastly helpful. Like lots
45:58 of people have said that study groups
45:59 give them the motivation and stuff to
46:01 self-study. So I think for people who
46:03 are of that like uh personality it would
46:07 be very helpful for them maybe. But
46:09 personally I don't like them.
46:10 Mhm. Or maybe other thing that study
46:13 groups help with is the deadlines. So
46:16 you as a group decide on the deadlines
46:18 and then you walk through a course even
46:19 if this course is a self-paced course
46:22 then it kind of work is a like in a
46:24 small cohort sort of like
46:28 I've never I've never seen any appeal in
46:30 that myself because that's just not like
46:32 how I like studying but I assume for
46:34 people who like the social part they'd
46:37 be they'd be a lot more motivated even
46:39 with like multiple people doing it or
46:41 something
46:43 and then I think at the beginning you
46:45 said one of the goals goals you have is
46:47 to break into machine learning.
46:49 Yeah.
46:49 And uh so having this goal, does it help
46:52 you to actually focus on studying and
46:54 selecting which kind of material you
46:56 want to uh focus on and things like
46:59 that?
46:59 Yeah, definitely. Because now I'm
47:01 looking at I'm reading more about
47:03 machine learning. I'm trying to like
47:05 learn more about how the industry works.
47:07 I'm trying to find that what type of
47:08 opportunities are open in machine
47:10 learning because now I'm like serious.
47:11 Okay, I want to do machine learning.
47:12 Whereas previously at most I've had like
47:14 a passing interest in machine learning
47:16 like okay it's cool but I don't know if
47:17 I'm doing it or no. So I never paid as
47:19 much attention to it. Whereas now I'm
47:21 like okay I need to seriously do this.
47:22 So I should find resources. I should try
47:24 and make connections in the machine
47:25 learning world. I must try and get my
47:28 name out there.
47:33 Sorry. Sorry. I got a bit distracted
47:35 with
47:37 F1 call for some reasons
47:41 and my phone will die
47:44 too cuz I I lost um live chat. Anyways,
47:50 yeah. Um
47:54 and uh yeah, somebody keeps calling me.
47:57 Sorry.
48:02 Uh
48:04 I'm just wondering what else to ask you
48:08 because now I got distracted. Um maybe
48:11 zoom camp like um
48:15 what was the in the zoom camp there were
48:18 two kind of parts. So there was the data
48:21 science part more focused on machine
48:22 learning theory and then there was more
48:25 practical data machine learning
48:26 engineering part. Which one did you like
48:28 more?
48:30 Um, I don't know. I kind of like both.
48:33 Um, I didn't have like any particular
48:35 preference either way. I I didn't much
48:38 like the MLP like the cloud part with
48:40 like the Kubernetes and Docker because I
48:42 I don't like that.
48:43 No, I don't like it as much. It's like I
48:45 don't I don't want to I don't want to
48:47 focus on the MLOps part. Like obviously
48:48 I know it's necessary if you're going in
48:50 the industry or whatever but like I
48:52 preferred the working with code without
48:54 having to worry how how to get it
48:55 running in deployment but it wasn't I
48:59 like the way it was handled in the zoom
49:01 camp. Um I actually thought it was a lot
49:03 more difficult from like what I had seen
49:05 briefly out of the zoom camp. But then
49:07 okay this is maybe not so bad like after
49:10 I done it but like before especially
49:12 before like we reached those modules I
49:14 was like oh goodness we have to do like
49:15 docker because I was like I was very
49:17 much daunted by the fact that docker is
49:19 like this huge thing. I was like okay
49:21 it's not so bad it's fine I can do this.
49:23 But like I think those are probably my
49:24 least favorite segments was the
49:26 especially the kubernetes.
49:28 Mhm. Do you have any tips for anyone who
49:31 wants to start a mazoom camp as a
49:34 student now for example in a self-paced
49:36 mode?
49:37 Um tips I don't know use the
49:42 you suggest approach studying it.
49:46 Um I don't know I never really thought
49:48 that much about um doing it. I was just
49:50 like okay I'm doing this maybe I don't
49:52 know I think I I did find the Slack
49:54 community very helpful. Um, and I think
49:57 one of the like the Slack community, not
50:00 only like asking them questions because
50:02 to be honest, I didn't do that as much.
50:03 I preferred Googling instead of asking
50:05 on the Slack, but even like just reading
50:07 it and if anybody's stuck helping them
50:10 because like in trying to help them, you
50:11 realize that okay, I never understood
50:13 this as well as I thought I did. And
50:15 then if you're like helping them with
50:16 things, you can further your own
50:18 understanding. So I think that was like
50:21 kind of the one thing maybe I could
50:24 give. I don't know what to give for
50:26 tips.
50:27 That's a good tip. I think u at least
50:29 for me teaching is the best way of
50:31 learning something.
50:32 So when I can explain a concept then I
50:36 am fairly confident that I probably
50:38 understand it more or less.
50:39 Yeah. Because explaining in a way that
50:41 somebody else understands is so much
50:42 harder and like I'm not I don't like
50:45 going in Slack communities and
50:47 interacting with people because I don't
50:48 like doing that. But I tried to make a
50:51 point of doing it in this um zoom camp
50:53 and like grudgingly I must say that okay
50:56 it did help me understand this better
50:57 when I had to tell like help other
50:59 people doing it
51:02 then uh I don't know if you use it uh
51:04 and maybe you're uh
51:08 you're tired of hearing about chpt but
51:10 what I found it useful also is just
51:13 talking to the to to the chatbot about a
51:18 topic and then just asking it questions
51:19 and then making sure I understand it.
51:22 Yeah, that was very helpful. I guess for
51:24 you, you said you don't really like
51:25 study groups. Um, but yeah, it's like,
51:29 you know, having appear
51:30 a fake a fake a fake study group.
51:32 Yeah, a fake study group. Exactly.
51:34 Yeah, I never thought about using JP in
51:37 that way before. That's interesting.
51:40 Do you use it at all?
51:42 I have like messed with it a few times
51:43 but not like actually used it because
51:45 I've never like I still go to Google
51:47 first and never thought that I should
51:49 ask JPG.
51:52 Yeah, interesting. Um well let's see I
51:56 think we have a few questions. Um
51:59 um yeah one question is how can we learn
52:03 about advanced topics like PhD level
52:05 courses?
52:07 interesting.
52:08 Um, yeah, that could be hard. Like I
52:11 don't know. I'm not sure how much like
52:13 how advanced you could go in. Like there
52:16 are lots of post-graduate resources
52:17 available online as well. Like you might
52:19 have to pay there might be more paid
52:21 than free. There might not be as much
52:22 free resources, but I think you could um
52:25 go a bit way like with paid resources
52:27 and reading research articles and like I
52:30 I definitely think it is possible but
52:33 maybe harder than doing like undergrad
52:36 stuff. because there's a lot of
52:37 resources for undergrad and maybe not
52:39 that many for like PhD or whatever.
52:42 Yeah. Because I guess there is more
52:44 demand for beginner level stuff.
52:46 Yeah. Yeah. And I think people I don't
52:49 know if like that many people who are
52:51 doing online self-study pursue that
52:54 degree like that high level of study or
52:56 no but I think it is possible. I like I
52:58 don't think it is impossible. So it
53:00 might just be harder to study that that
53:01 kind of stuff on your own.
53:04 And also doing PhD on by yourself is
53:08 probably
53:10 difficult in a sense that uh you
53:13 probably need an institution that helps
53:15 you with research, helps with
53:17 connections, helps you with access to I
53:19 don't know labs or whatever.
53:21 Yeah. I don't know if you can like I
53:23 don't even think it's possible to get a
53:24 PhD like PhD level entirely by yourself,
53:28 but I'm not I've never really researched
53:30 officially getting a PhD if you've not
53:32 gone to like uni or school before. I'm
53:34 not sure how that would work.
53:37 Publish a paper without
53:38 Yeah. Yeah. I think you could get to
53:40 that knowledge level on your own.
53:45 Yeah. But and uh also like if you spend
53:49 time doing this you need to live on
53:52 something like you need to eat or
53:55 obviously
53:55 because usually university pays money
53:57 right and
53:59 if you don't get income and you spend
54:01 like six years doing research can be
54:03 tricky
54:07 that's that's the practicalities of it
54:11 but the main resource here is papers
54:13 right so there are there are no not so
54:15 any other resources that you can use
54:17 that like there is no zoom camp about uh
54:19 some PhD level topic.
54:21 Yeah, I don't think so. Um the but there
54:23 might be like um I think papers must be
54:26 the major ones or like getting if you
54:27 can get like subscription to libraries
54:29 or something where they have more um
54:31 in-depth stuff. I'm not sure like how
54:33 that would work because not something
54:35 I've like heavily researched myself like
54:37 I've now been interested in getting to a
54:39 PhD. So
54:41 by libraries you mean like these
54:43 electronic libraries from Springer or
54:46 Nature or
54:47 Yeah. Yeah. Something like a publication
54:49 that can get you access to like a lot
54:51 more of the the higher level stuff than
54:53 you can get access
54:54 like E ACM this kind of I guess
54:57 organizations.
54:58 Yeah. Well, I'm assuming like being in a
55:00 uni would give you access to because
55:01 like a lot of them have like if you have
55:03 like uni email address or stuff you can
55:04 login. So I'm assuming that is the kind
55:06 of stuff that uni already gives you
55:08 access to. So
55:10 I remember having access to all these
55:12 major
55:13 uh I didn't have to pay for for reading
55:16 articles
55:17 because like it's another topic for
55:18 discussion right why do you need to pay
55:20 50 for a three-page four page scientific
55:25 article
55:27 also funny that researcher who publish
55:29 articles need to pay to publish articles
55:31 so like this is wrong on so many levels
55:34 yeah it's like um I'm in a lot of um
55:38 scientific ific communities on Twitter
55:39 and more than half of them are always
55:41 complaining about how hard it is to just
55:44 get researches published. Like you think
55:46 that scientific institutions would be
55:48 more welcoming of like it's new
55:49 research. It's cool. Want to learn more
55:51 about the world, but also you have to
55:53 jump like five billion hoops and pay
55:54 your arm and a leg just to get your
55:56 research out there. So like it's seems
55:58 like a very counterintuitive process.
56:00 Yeah. That's why I like this archive
56:03 where it's just all the preprints prints
56:06 are there.
56:06 But then again, you have to do a lot of
56:08 filtering yourself. You don't know if
56:10 the paper a paper from archive is good
56:13 or it's not.
56:14 Yeah, I assume that is like some of the
56:16 money that they charge for like you get
56:17 curated resources like there's a lot
56:20 less chance of bad publications coming
56:23 in those.
56:26 And then another question is related to
56:28 uh burnout. I don't know if you ever had
56:31 to deal with anything like that. Like
56:33 when you you cannot just study anything
56:35 and all you want to do is I don't know
56:37 watch YouTube videos with cats.
56:40 Did it ever happen to you?
56:42 Um I don't know. I don't think so. I
56:45 like I haven't I don't know. I haven't
56:48 really like taken a break in a while. So
56:50 I'm not really sure. I feel like if I
56:52 would stop then maybe there would be an
56:53 issue. But like I just it's fine. I've
56:55 just been going for a while. So like I
56:57 have the momentum
57:00 and uh probably you mentioned a few
57:02 times that you like to switch between
57:05 topics like one day you
57:08 read about machine learning and then the
57:09 other day you create uh illustrations
57:12 right?
57:13 Yeah
57:13 this helps right? Yeah, like I switch
57:16 between a lot of thing like um right now
57:19 I have I would switch between like my
57:20 bioinformatics, machine learning and I
57:23 have in my illustration I have like two
57:25 or three different projects I'm doing at
57:27 the same time. So it's like if I get
57:29 bored of one thing I'm like okay hop
57:30 onto the other hop onto the other. So
57:31 like I have like a fallback route
57:33 instead of like getting doing nothing
57:36 like if I were doing only one thing I
57:38 feel this would be a bigger issue
57:39 because I do get bored of things very
57:41 easily. So, I'm like, "Okay, I'm sick of
57:43 this. I don't want to do it because I
57:44 did it like two days in a row, which I
57:46 know it's not a lot, but it's like I
57:47 don't want to do this anymore." So, I
57:48 have like I can work on another project.
57:50 I can do something else. And then I'm
57:52 like, "Okay, I have some I I have some
57:54 more interest in that project a few days
57:55 later."
57:57 Yeah. Interesting. Well, I think we
58:00 should be slowly slowly wrapping up. So,
58:02 maybe last question is are there any
58:06 books or other good resources that you
58:08 can recommend to the listeners?
58:11 Um
58:13 that's a hard one because I crisses on
58:15 watching
58:16 machine learning
58:17 writing machine learning u learning in
58:20 general binformatics anything you think
58:22 that would be interesting for the
58:25 listeners
58:27 um
58:28 for Python I can recommend like I had
58:30 done a course which was pretty which was
58:32 very interesting was Python for
58:34 everybody and I liked it because the
58:36 person was not spending too long on the
58:39 stuff it was a bit of a fast pace, but
58:41 also it he went into a bit more in depth
58:44 than like okay write so and so syntax
58:47 because just because um machine learning
58:50 I haven't like looked up that many
58:52 resources as I have for other stuff but
58:53 like I can recommend the zoom camp and
58:56 your book because I found those helpful
58:59 and um I would say that they're like
59:01 good resources so I think I can
59:03 recommend those and for like the thing
59:07 is I haven't spent like a lot of I'm
59:10 following specific resources because I
59:12 jump between them so much. So it's hard
59:14 for me to say like there's so many which
59:16 I would have to like I could dig into my
59:18 resources and say so it's hard to like
59:20 say off the top of my mind that okay
59:22 that's a good resource.
59:24 Did you take any course about studying?
59:26 I know that there is a course on Corsera
59:28 learning to learn something like this.
59:30 Did you ever took did you ever take
59:33 anything like that or from your school
59:35 homeschooling you kind of knew how to to
59:38 No, I haven't really taken anything. Um
59:40 I did see I have seen that learning how
59:43 to learn course and I think I watched it
59:45 like introduction or something but I was
59:47 so bored but I just closed it. I didn't
59:48 like watch it further.
59:52 Okay then um that's all we have time for
59:55 today. Thanks a lot for joining us today
59:58 for sharing your experience about self
1:00:00 learning and thanks everyone also for
1:00:02 joining us today for listening in and um
