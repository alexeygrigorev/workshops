From Digital Marketing to Analytics Engineering

0:00 So this week we'll talk about switching
0:01 careers from marketing to analytics
0:04 engineering. And we have a special guest
0:06 today, Nicola. So Nikki started her
0:09 career as a performance marketing
0:11 specialist. Um and uh um she quickly
0:15 realized that she needs to rely on data
0:18 to make good decisions. That's how her
0:19 data journey started and she eventually
0:21 became an analytics engineer. And in
0:23 this interview we'll know how that
0:25 happened. So welcome to our uh to our
0:28 event.
0:30 Thank you very much for having me
0:32 and um so I want to mention so this is
0:35 something new uh questions for this
0:38 interview were prepared by Lead Shamesh
0:41 and Victoria Perez Mola. So thanks a lot
0:43 for your help in uh in preparing the
0:46 questions and if anyone here who is
0:48 listening want to help us prepare for
0:50 more interviews in the future please
0:52 reach out to me. Okay and let's start.
0:55 So before we go into our main topic of
0:58 switching to analytics engineering,
1:00 let's start with your background. Can
1:02 you tell us about your career journey so
1:03 far?
1:04 Yeah, of course. Um, so yeah, I actually
1:08 uh studied in the UK in London and I
1:10 moved over to Berlin soon after
1:12 graduating from my bachelor's um quite
1:15 spontaneously. Um, and I found myself uh
1:19 just in the Berlin startup scene like
1:22 many English speaking people do uh
1:25 because it was pretty much the only
1:27 available um route. So I started out
1:30 working for Minga which was a big um
1:34 removals startup um backed by Rocket
1:37 Internet and I was working in the
1:39 operations um team there. So I kind of
1:42 had my first um taste of working at a
1:45 startup um there. That was of course as
1:48 you can imagine very um intense, fast
1:51 growth, lots of change. Um so it was
1:53 kind of a baptism of fire um for six
1:57 months and after that I uh found uh a
2:01 job at Eosia. Um I was really following
2:03 EOSIA really closely because I really
2:05 was inspired by the business model and
2:08 the mission. So for those who don't
2:10 know, Kosia is the uh search engine that
2:13 uses its profits to plant trees. Um so
2:17 yeah, it's essentially um uh it's a
2:20 purpose company which [clears throat]
2:21 means that yeah, profits are basically
2:23 entirely used towards um yeah, financing
2:27 uh the tree planting projects. Um so
2:30 yeah then I suddenly saw a job for a
2:33 kind of generalist marketing role uh
2:36 which I applied for. Um and yeah so my
2:40 first role at Kosia was actually um sort
2:43 of more generic marketing. Um
2:46 was it something that you also did at
2:49 Minga like not at all or was it
2:52 something different?
2:53 It was completely different. Um, but it
2:54 was stuff that um it was kind of a lots
2:57 of a generalist kind of junior role
2:59 where you're kind of helping like write
3:00 press releases um think up campaigns
3:05 um yeah reaching out to potential
3:07 partners this kind of work. And I'd done
3:09 quite a lot of that through university
3:11 and I've been volunteering for a um uh
3:15 an organization that helped students get
3:18 into um volunteering. Um so through that
3:22 kind of work and through more kind of
3:24 actually not professional um work rather
3:27 just like um more organizing political
3:32 work and stuff I'd done at university.
3:34 That's kind of where I had those um
3:36 event event planning um where I built up
3:40 those kind of organizational and sort of
3:42 marketing skills from. So that's
3:44 essentially what what um I ended up
3:46 really speaking about largely at the at
3:47 the interview. Um and we were a really
3:50 small company. We were 15 um
3:53 uh people when I joined. Um so it was
3:56 really one of those early stage kind of
3:57 startup. You're doing sort of whatever
3:59 job needs to be done. Sometimes it was
4:01 replying to user feedback. Other times
4:04 it was helping test or um yeah new app
4:08 design or all sorts of things. Um but
4:12 yeah, at some point I um felt like I
4:16 really wanted to go deeper into an area
4:20 and um yeah, I basically started running
4:23 the um paid campaigns that we sort of
4:28 started doing um after I joined the
4:30 company um first on Facebook but later
4:32 then we expanded onto uh YouTube and
4:34 Instagram. Um, and I really enjoyed um
4:39 that. I found it very helpful to really
4:41 focus in um on a specific um area. And
4:45 something I found very gratifying about
4:47 performance marketing was you get kind
4:48 of results very quickly. So you can kind
4:51 of really see what's working and what's
4:53 not working. um as opposed to other
4:54 areas of marketing where something like
4:57 you know a press campaign or um a brand
5:01 um activation you know it's not
5:02 necessarily clear what impact that might
5:05 have had right away and sometimes it's
5:07 really difficult or almost impossible to
5:08 measure
5:10 which I found very frustrating
5:13 um but with performance marketing like
5:15 the data you're given immediately and
5:17 you can analyze that and make a decision
5:19 in in minutes on how to to move forward
5:23 Um so I got really really into that. I
5:25 had um and of course there are so many
5:28 online resources for performance
5:29 marketing and in general and it's
5:32 relatively new discipline as well in the
5:34 yeah grand scheme of history of
5:36 marketing. So um yeah I was really able
5:39 to kind of uh dive into that by myself
5:42 largely
5:44 um and I was given a lot of
5:45 responsibility at the company as well.
5:47 So I yeah learned that way. I did that
5:50 for two years. Um, and at some point I
5:54 also started to kind of think, okay,
5:56 well I feel like I've kind of understood
6:00 this and it maybe has its like limits in
6:02 terms of um what's interesting or not.
6:05 So, and the part that I really enjoyed
6:07 was looking looking at the data coming
6:10 in, analyzing what are the click-through
6:12 rates saying, what are the conversion
6:13 rates, what does that mean? um um yeah,
6:17 how can we optimize this campaign based
6:19 on the data that we're getting? Uh how
6:22 does it compare with historical trends?
6:24 All of this sort of work I really
6:26 enjoyed.
6:27 Um and at the same time I'd um around
6:31 this time the company uh had switched to
6:33 lookup from Tableau. [snorts] Um and at
6:36 the time we only had one um data um
6:40 person at AOSIA. Um so I helped um her
6:44 with the uh migration to looker just as
6:47 like a side project and since I was kind
6:50 of the person who was most comfortable
6:52 with data and reporting and numbers and
6:55 um yeah measuring KPIs and whatnot in
6:58 the marketing team I took on building
7:00 out the marketing team reporting
7:03 and I really enjoyed that.
7:04 It was your initiative right? So nobody
7:06 like told you hey you should do this.
7:08 you just okay like sounds interesting. I
7:10 really like this topic and I kind of
7:11 learned everything that was there about
7:14 performance marketing. So let me try to
7:16 also learn this new tool.
7:18 Yeah, exactly. And I think at this point
7:20 it wasn't really clear to me that I
7:21 wanted to necessarily move into the data
7:23 team. I just wanted to maybe have more
7:26 focus on numbers and uh data in general
7:29 but probably still within the marketing
7:31 team. Um
7:33 and then eventually I think what the big
7:36 shift happened was I think the pandemic
7:38 um hit and I think like a lot of people
7:42 just forced me to to consider um yeah
7:47 what I was doing and whether I was happy
7:48 in my role and I really found that I I
7:50 really wasn't um and at this point I
7:54 decided to
7:56 um yeah make the shift um into the BI
8:01 team and I
8:02 At this point, I'd already been um I'd
8:05 already done a SQL course um some months
8:08 before um I guess with a view to going
8:13 down the kind of marketing analytics
8:15 route. Um but with the pandemic, I
8:18 really realized that I wanted to move
8:20 away from yeah purely marketing focus
8:24 and go yeah towards um yeah BI. Mhm.
8:29 Were you taking the courses the SQL SQL
8:32 courses? No. Like did you have a plan
8:36 that you want to work in the BI team
8:39 eventually or it was like okay let me
8:41 see what I should do to I don't know do
8:43 my job better.
8:45 I think um I remember speaking to the to
8:48 the um my colleague in the BI team who I
8:53 think in the context rather of being a
8:56 sort of like marketing analyst person. I
8:58 think initially the idea was kind of I'd
9:00 sit maybe between marketing and BI. Um
9:05 but I think it's because I sort of
9:06 really didn't think it was possible for
9:08 me to move um departments. That hadn't
9:11 really happened in the company before.
9:12 So there wasn't really an example of
9:14 that.
9:15 um to me. Um so I think I was kind of
9:18 rather thinking well what's possible?
9:20 What could I do? And then it was this
9:22 kind of marketing analyst role. Um but
9:26 uh yeah definitely I took the SQL course
9:30 in order to yeah move closer towards the
9:33 um yeah data side of the
9:36 how did you so then you realized okay
9:39 maybe I'm not really super happy with u
9:41 the job I'm doing in the marketing
9:43 department and then there is this BI
9:45 team so did you just approach them and
9:48 say and ask can I just join you and
9:51 start working with you or how did this
9:52 happen Yeah, I think eventually,
9:56 yes, I think eventually the conversation
9:58 was already there as I mentioned before
10:00 around how to become more into this
10:03 marketing analyst role. And
10:06 already my colleague was giving me lots
10:08 of advice and I think probably through
10:11 that process and conversations the
10:14 possibility of me moving into the BI
10:16 team like came up to be honest. I don't
10:18 remember exactly who brought it up. Um
10:22 but um I think what I remember is you
10:27 know the my colleagues my colleague in
10:29 VI saying well these are the things that
10:31 we really need you to have and then once
10:35 you have those things you can there's no
10:37 reason why you shouldn't be able to join
10:39 the team as a as a junior analyst. Um
10:42 do you remember what these things were
10:44 like SQL I suppose? Yeah, SQL was the
10:47 main thing and then um learning the uh
10:50 learning understanding the data pipeline
10:52 that we had.
10:54 Um
10:54 so it wasn't like a list of courses you
10:56 have to take but rather okay these are
10:58 the things we work on and try to figure
11:01 out what's happening there.
11:02 Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I think in terms
11:05 of the C I mean she even you know one of
11:07 the things was like Python would be
11:09 great but I ended up doing a Python
11:12 course but barely actually using it and
11:16 um it's yeah it's been useful to have
11:19 but of all the things I think the most
11:22 useful practically was jumping into the
11:27 once once learning SQL is then once you
11:30 know SQL and you can write and read SQL
11:32 you'll still need to get good at reading
11:34 and writing SQL and you start coming
11:36 across much more complicated SQL queries
11:38 and you're like there's like a
11:40 nested loop here and like I don't know
11:42 where this is coming from. So then
11:44 improving the your SQL to be able to to
11:48 read and understand uh much more complex
11:51 data models. So that was kind of a big
11:53 part of the journey um was really
11:55 understanding
11:56 um what our models were, how everything
12:00 um yeah fit together in the wider scheme
12:03 of the pipeline and how it came to be
12:05 that um because I had no idea even like
12:08 what really how a tracker really worked.
12:10 I just sort of knew that there was this
12:11 thing called the snowplow tracker that
12:13 like collected the data but it was all
12:15 sort of um
12:18 uh yeah not not very like detailed
12:20 knowledge. So really going in and
12:22 understanding like how things really
12:24 work um to get the data from one point
12:27 to the other and transform it. Um
12:29 did you need to keep doing your you know
12:32 old job of a marketing specialist or you
12:36 completely could like start like just uh
12:41 start I don't know immerse yourself in
12:44 in this BI or there was like some in
12:48 between period where you had to do both.
12:50 Yeah, I think it was um well to be
12:53 honest I'd already been doing as part of
12:56 the performance marketing role. I was
12:57 also doing I was really acting like a
12:59 kind of marketing analyst in a way and
13:02 building the reporting for the teams and
13:04 you know people who were doing other
13:05 jobs. I was kind of helping them build
13:08 reports and managing that. So I was
13:10 already kind of doing a lot of that kind
13:12 of work. So there was a transition
13:14 period where kind of the first projects
13:16 that I worked on was sort of more
13:18 marketing focused like I think one of
13:20 the main projects was um helping
13:24 establish like how to measure brand
13:27 campaigns.
13:28 Um yeah, looking into that and like
13:31 building dashboards based for that and
13:33 kind of a wider topic around that and
13:36 but yeah I think it was kind of a a
13:38 transition but at some point um yeah I
13:42 just handed over the main performance
13:43 marketing tasks which are managing the
13:46 campaigns but it was it was quite a good
13:48 moment because the pandemic meant that
13:53 um we were already hitting a a kind of
13:55 slight stagnation point with some of our
13:57 campaigns and then pandemic hit and it
13:59 was really difficult to record new new
14:02 ads as well um in quarantine. So, um
14:06 there was a kind of natural slowing down
14:08 of of that side of the work anyway. So,
14:10 it was a good moment to um to pivot.
14:14 And what do you do now? What what do
14:17 your responsibilities include?
14:20 So, I'm working as a yeah as as
14:22 mentioned an analytics engineer but also
14:24 data analyst. So, we are still a
14:26 relatively small team. We are um four
14:29 people in in total. Um uh yeah, for
14:33 reference, the company size is just over
14:35 100. Um so we um don't none of us have a
14:41 particularly specialized role. We kind
14:43 of do a little bit of everything. Um at
14:46 the moment um our team lead is on
14:49 extended uh leave. So I'm acting as
14:51 interim um team lead. So a lot of work
14:54 is really working with the new CPO who's
14:57 just come in reassessing with KPIs that
15:00 we have as a company, how we measure
15:01 them. Um yeah, of course um as a quite
15:07 common when I think a new sea level
15:08 comes in, there's often a rehashing of
15:10 dashboards and um reworking of the the
15:14 core reporting um to suit the new the
15:17 new requirements. Um so a lot of work
15:19 has been recently done on that. Um
15:23 we also each of there's like two two of
15:26 us that are kind of these analyst um in
15:30 analyst roles and we work very closely
15:32 with the product managers. So we're
15:34 focusing very closely on supporting the
15:36 various product teams with
15:37 experimentation
15:39 [snorts]
15:39 um building out new features um AB
15:42 testing um evaluating those and yeah
15:45 where necessary um building out our data
15:49 model to um to reflect those new uh
15:52 changes. Um yeah so I think the
15:55 day-to-day is really a mixture of um
15:59 supporting the teams. So a lot of
16:02 sometimes ad hoc analysis needed if for
16:05 example there is a new feature being
16:07 developed and there's some hypothesis
16:09 around yeah um yeah the kind of user
16:13 that they want to reach and how big
16:14 those cohorts might be kind of yeah
16:16 jumping into the data and taking a look
16:19 at that and other work is maybe more on
16:22 an initiative of our own. So for example
16:25 recently we ran a big um RFM analysis.
16:28 So recency, frequency, monetary, user
16:31 behavior analysis
16:33 um which was a bigger project um because
16:36 yeah there's many ways to do it and we
16:39 took some time to kind of experiment
16:40 with some different options and that was
16:42 a that's been a larger project over some
16:44 months with several presentations of of
16:47 insights and yeah so there's kind of
16:49 those bits of work that aren't
16:50 necessarily um we're not necessarily
16:53 working directly for an individual
16:55 product manager but yeah working on
16:56 wider pieces of um analysis and insight
17:01 that's beneficial kind of for the for
17:02 the company as a whole.
17:05 I think I you're not finished there.
17:09 Um I just wanted to add that yeah we've
17:11 also recently started doing a few small
17:13 data science projects in the team just
17:15 on the side
17:17 um which uh I myself I'm not directly
17:19 involved with but one of my colleagues
17:21 is yeah we're trying to basically um
17:26 um run some NLP um uh models on
17:31 basically trying to improve how we
17:34 understand basically queries um that our
17:36 users make and trying essentially to
17:38 build better query categorization uh so
17:41 we can ultimately serve better results.
17:43 And that's been really nice that we've
17:46 been able to kind of pick up some more
17:47 yeah data sciency topics in the team and
17:50 not kind of work exclusively on sort of
17:54 um yeah sort of reporting and um yeah
17:58 internal [snorts]
17:59 and this query understanding is it's
18:02 about understanding intent right so why
18:04 a user is searching some information
18:06 like do they want to like navigate to a
18:10 certain website do they want to get some
18:12 information do they want to buy
18:13 something.
18:14 Yeah, exactly. Specifically, it's around
18:17 kind of being able to segment your
18:20 various queries into the correct
18:21 categories. So, does this query or you
18:25 know query group fall into the category
18:27 of travel or
18:28 uh okay
18:29 shopping or um transport or yeah etc.
18:34 So different kind of categorization
18:36 and when you describing what kind of
18:38 duties you have, what kind of things you
18:41 work on. So you mentioned uh that you're
18:43 working on um KPIs, dashboards or like
18:48 like what else was there experiment
18:50 supporting product teams with
18:51 experiments
18:53 um
18:55 ad hoc analytics and then you mentioned
18:57 the data model. So up to the data model
18:59 I think I understood more or less uh
19:01 what you were doing but what is a what
19:03 is data model? Why do you need to build
19:05 a data model? Why do you need to update
19:06 it? So we have a um we built our data in
19:12 DBT based on something called the domain
19:15 mod a domain model. So we began um
19:20 basically uh two two or so years ago
19:24 maybe even longer now. Uh we migrated
19:26 from uh to to DBT and in that moment we
19:31 basically rewrote
19:34 um all our uh basically queries and to
19:38 build all our tables or the whole data
19:40 model was re rebuilt from scratch um
19:42 because yeah it had evolved over time.
19:44 We had something like six install tables
19:47 um or something like ridiculous that
19:49 just sort of
19:50 six what tables?
19:51 Install. Yeah, like tables.
19:54 The data model is about describing what
19:57 kind of data you have like all these
19:59 schema definitions, right?
20:00 Ah yeah. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. So for the
20:01 data model, what I mean is kind of the
20:04 what we have in dbt essentially is all
20:07 of our different um uh transformation
20:10 logic for the entire um business. So
20:13 from
20:14 uh from the most basic sort of staging
20:17 layer through down to the presentation
20:19 um tables that we then um yeah use for
20:24 analysis.
20:25 Um
20:28 yeah I you wanted to finish right or
20:32 no go for it.
20:33 Yeah so I was just trying to understand
20:36 what kind of tools you use. So you
20:38 mentioned three tools already. So you
20:39 mentioned snowplow right? Right. So,
20:41 snowplow is a tool for tracking, right?
20:44 So, to understand what kind of actions
20:46 users perform and saving these actions,
20:49 right? Then you also mentioned DBT which
20:51 is a tool for transformation, right? So,
20:53 you have some data sitting somewhere and
20:55 you need to um re
20:58 change it slightly like uh aggregate
21:01 right and then put it in such a form
21:03 that you can use for reports right and
21:06 you also have DB looker. Looker is a
21:09 tool for uh dashboards, right? What else
21:12 do you use? So, probably use some sort
21:14 of database, a data warehouse, right?
21:16 Maybe some other tools too.
21:18 Yeah, exactly. So, we use um we use um
21:22 yeah AWS services. So, we use S3 and
21:24 Redshift
21:26 um and also Spectrum as well
21:29 um yeah to query um yeah Athena. So we
21:33 really uh we play around a lot with yeah
21:36 so called hot and cold storage. So
21:38 keeping data in red shift versus keeping
21:40 it in S3 in parket files. Um that's due
21:44 to cost optimization.
21:46 Um so yeah that's what we use for our
21:48 our lake um warehouse. Um and then we
21:52 use um airflow as well as our
21:54 orchestration tool. Um and uh yeah for
21:58 our um extracting and loading
22:02 operations. Was it a part of your job to
22:05 set up all these tools?
22:08 Um, it was part of my job to set up DBT.
22:10 Yes.
22:11 Um, so that was one of the first big
22:13 projects. Um, so I'd been in the team
22:15 for maybe six months or so and then we
22:17 began the migration to DBT. Uh, and we
22:20 actually worked with a data consultancy
22:23 um, a small one to just help us because
22:26 yeah, we were essentially three people.
22:28 Um
22:29 and my yeah I led that project um was
22:33 one of my first big projects. Um which
22:36 was great. It was a really big learning
22:37 curve and I got to learn yeah not only
22:39 about yeah DBT the tool itself but also
22:42 data modeling theory and practices and
22:45 different ways of uh doing things what
22:48 makes sense depending on the size of
22:50 your data and your your goals and needs.
22:52 That was really great. Um yeah so dbt is
22:56 is the main one. Looker as well as I
22:58 mentioned I helped to to um to to um
23:03 migrate to and implement for the
23:05 company.
23:06 It was before you actually joined API
23:08 team right? So you started as a in
23:11 marketing looking at this.
23:12 Okay. So I actually strangely learned
23:14 like look before I learned SQL which is
23:16 a slightly strange I think way of doing
23:19 things but there we go. That's how it
23:21 happened. Um yeah and airflow um was um
23:26 set up by our my colleague who is uh has
23:30 more of a data engineering role within
23:31 the team.
23:32 Mh.
23:33 Um and that was also set up relatively
23:37 uh relatively recently in the last like
23:38 two three years or so. Um yeah those are
23:41 the main uh tools. recently started
23:44 using Airbite
23:46 um that some people might be familiar
23:48 with to
23:50 yeah basically be able to extract from
23:53 some kind of common APIs um data sources
23:56 um we haven't used it extensively so far
23:59 we often find that it's got a lot of
24:01 options but specifically what we need um
24:03 often it doesn't necessarily have the
24:05 connection yet but it's been a it's a
24:07 nice I think it's a nice tool relatively
24:10 easy to use um and we've also recently
24:13 started using Redash which is like an
24:15 open source visualization tool that we
24:16 use for more like ad hoc queries that
24:20 yeah to be able to have a visualization
24:22 attached to them um as well. It seems
24:26 like most of the tools are open source.
24:28 Well, apart from AWS, right? I don't
24:30 know about Lucer is Lucer open source.
24:33 No, no, I don't think
24:34 but the rest are right. So, Snowplow is
24:36 open source. DBT is open source. Air air
24:39 bite is open source. Redash, I don't
24:40 know. Are they
24:41 Redash is is open source as well?
24:44 Yeah.
24:44 So, you you you like open source, don't
24:46 you?
24:47 Yes,
24:49 exactly. Um,
24:51 do you host all these things yourself or
24:53 like for example when it comes to DBT,
24:55 you use their cloud?
24:57 No, we host everything ourselves.
24:59 Mhm.
25:00 Yeah, that's just a general decision of
25:02 the
25:03 uh engineering department essentially.
25:06 And when you joined the PI team, was
25:09 your role already called analytics
25:10 engineer or you just over time realized
25:13 that okay, this is how I should call
25:15 myself? Um well my official role is
25:18 analytics engineer and data analyst
25:19 because I really do both. Um we're not
25:22 the size of a BI team that it's possible
25:25 for someone to do just one. It's too
25:27 much to do um role but I think initially
25:30 it was I don't know what the title was
25:32 initially BI analyst or something data
25:35 analyst. And then I think at that point
25:39 even the the term analytics engineer
25:41 really wasn't common. Uh I think I
25:44 really only learned about that in the
25:46 process of um implementing DBT which was
25:49 in 2020.
25:52 So yeah really some time has passed I
25:54 think since a DBT is ob obviously become
25:58 huge um in the data community and I
26:01 think this role of analyst engineer is
26:03 becoming also much more common but I
26:06 think at the time when I joined the team
26:07 that wasn't even a um an option I think
26:11 I don't think anyone even um thought of
26:14 that I don't think the people in the BI
26:16 team were actually calling themselves
26:17 that themselves even though that's
26:19 essentially the job they were doing Um
26:21 so yeah over time as we all um became
26:25 familiar with that new term and realized
26:27 that it basically described what we were
26:29 doing um yeah then that was um yeah
26:34 taken on.
26:35 Mhm.
26:36 Do do you think there's some hype in uh
26:38 in that role? I mean that it's there was
26:41 no such thing and now then all of a
26:43 sudden everyone's talking about
26:44 analytics.
26:47 Yeah. I think to be honest I think
26:49 there's if you're talking
26:51 if you have a small BI team um you know
26:54 I think
26:56 you know six or less people in the team
26:59 I mean I guess depending on your on your
27:01 on your company and your product and the
27:03 and the business um business model but I
27:06 think it's a little bit overhyped I mean
27:08 ultimately I still think that you need
27:12 quite a large organization to be able to
27:14 comfortably segment data analyst and
27:17 analytics engineer they have so much
27:19 crossover anyway
27:20 I can see that in larger organizations
27:22 it's really helpful to have the the
27:24 separation but I think in smaller ones
27:27 it's not so um at least in in my
27:30 experience which is yeah simply this is
27:32 this one company um I can't speak for
27:36 others I found that it's uh it's helpful
27:39 in terms of your own personal progress
27:42 because you can sort of align yourself
27:44 with this role and see okay yes this is
27:47 this is what I do this is somewhere
27:48 where I could improve and an area that
27:51 yeah, I could spend more time on, but
27:54 I'm not necessarily
27:56 Yeah, I think for most kind of small
27:59 mediumsiz companies, I don't think it's
28:00 necessary to get really bogged down into
28:02 the differences between the two because
28:05 ultimately
28:07 you're still going to need very
28:09 overlapping skills like you need to be u
28:12 very analytical, very comfortable with
28:13 your KPIs, what the business model is,
28:15 the domain model, all of that work which
28:17 is not limited to analytics. engineer, a
28:19 good data analyst needs all of those
28:21 things and more so um yeah I think
28:24 there's maybe a little bit of of hype
28:25 but again as I said it depends on the on
28:27 the on the organization side if you have
28:30 a huge company with a data or department
28:32 of 20 30 40 people then of course like
28:34 it it just makes like structural sense
28:37 to
28:38 to split out and focus
28:40 do do you think it is synonymous
28:44 to
28:45 uh using DPT like you use DPT Therefore,
28:49 you're an analytics engineer and if you
28:51 use if you're an analytics engineer then
28:53 you use DBT like uh are they the same
28:56 thing or you can't be an analytics
28:58 engineer without using DBT?
29:00 It's a good question. I mean I feel like
29:02 the DBT themselves have really promoted
29:06 this
29:07 I think
29:09 exactly. So [laughter]
29:11 you know in a way I think yeah it kind
29:14 of is synonymous like I don't I at least
29:17 haven't seen many job applications for
29:20 analytics engineer that haven't been
29:22 like your job is to work with DBT. So I
29:26 mean I'd be interested to kind of
29:29 see how whether that yeah how that role
29:31 could look with a different um stack and
29:36 I imagine there are people who are
29:38 working under the title of data engineer
29:40 or data analyst who you know
29:43 [clears throat]
29:43 do the work of analytics engineer but
29:45 just don't call themselves that in in
29:47 other companies that maybe don't use
29:48 because in the company where I work we
29:51 don't have DPT we have a homegrown DPT
29:54 kind of uh um uh not replacement but it
29:57 was before DBT was popular right yeah
30:00 so as many other companies we kind of
30:02 invented DBT which is like airflow based
30:05 way to schedule SQL queries right
30:09 um I don't think we none of our analysts
30:12 who use this tool call themselves
30:15 analytics engineers
30:17 so I'm wondering are there any tools
30:19 that are doing the same thing as DBT
30:22 apart from these homegrown tools like we
30:24 or are there any such things on the
30:26 market?
30:28 I don't know. Um to be honest,
30:32 [laughter] I haven't had the time to
30:34 really look in. I mean, I think at the
30:36 moment DBT is on such a growth
30:37 trajectory. It's being
30:39 I see so many Yeah. job ads for looking
30:44 for people to help them set up DBT. And
30:47 I think it's really taking off. So I
30:49 don't personally know but I I do
30:53 you know like you said we were
30:54 previously using SQL runner which is
30:56 like snowplow's kind of similar um ex
30:59 exactly what you described basically an
31:01 orchestration tool for SQL queries um
31:04 where yeah you can specify the order and
31:06 and whatnot and yeah incrementalization
31:09 strategies were not invented by dbt this
31:11 is there's many ways to to to set those
31:15 up um in those other kind of setups Um
31:20 so I think that for me analyst
31:22 engineering I think where for me the
31:25 focus there is on which for example with
31:28 the data analyst perhaps is not so much
31:30 the focus is really around I guess the
31:33 the wider architecture right of the data
31:36 model for me that's where the analytics
31:38 engineering role is really is really
31:42 important it's once you start collecting
31:45 you know various different data sources
31:47 you have you know all of these issues
31:49 around
31:51 uh consistency and um yeah of course
31:54 freshness and all of these various
31:56 concerns I think that this is where an
31:59 analytics engineer really needs to shine
32:02 is to understand how everything fits
32:04 together in this wider ecosystem which
32:08 um perhaps an analyst might know you
32:10 know doesn't necessarily need to
32:12 understand like the full um
32:16 all the transformations and how
32:17 everything connects to each other but an
32:20 an analytics engineer really really does
32:22 so I think this kind of focus on data
32:25 modeling like theory is much more
32:28 important
32:30 um so I think in that way it's kind of
32:32 slightly more like a theoretical um role
32:34 in many ways which I think is often not
32:36 really talked about um it's often like
32:38 techn like spoke of like technical which
32:41 which it is but I think that I think
32:45 it's really important to understand as
32:47 an analytics engineer, the different
32:48 kind of data modeling frameworks and
32:50 what's possible and um you know
32:55 whether having a you know a wider table
32:57 or a narrower table like why when in
32:59 which case should you go for one versus
33:01 the other um when should you choose a
33:04 certain kind of incrementalization when
33:06 not um strategy and so I think that's
33:10 that's kind of the part of the the role
33:13 that I think is probably
33:15 uh Yeah, very specific and
33:20 I guess becoming more and more important
33:22 just as there is so much more data that
33:24 companies in general are collecting. So
33:25 by virtue of
33:27 more companies, smaller companies,
33:30 different kinds of companies than the
33:31 traditional kind of big enterprises
33:33 start using and collecting data and
33:35 building up data departments then of
33:38 course like this becomes more of a need.
33:40 Um
33:42 I think
33:45 I'm curious about this data modeling
33:48 theory that you mentioned um and
33:50 selecting like whether it should be a
33:52 wide table, it should be narrow table.
33:55 If I wanted to learn more about this,
33:57 where do I go? What kind of resources do
34:00 I have about this?
34:01 That's a good question. I think I really
34:04 uh struggled a little bit with this
34:05 because there's really a lot of there's
34:07 a lot of quite I wouldn't even call it
34:09 advanced stuff but the textbooks and and
34:13 that you can buy on like data it's very
34:15 dry like I'll just be honest
34:17 Kimble right this kind of
34:19 like there's loads of textbooks and
34:21 something I think I studied at
34:23 university but never actually sold this
34:25 book outside of university
34:27 exactly to be honest like I' I've given
34:29 a good I've given them a good shot And I
34:32 found that
34:34 I just learned by doing. I learned
34:36 through talking to to people who' who
34:40 yeah were yeah my mentors or senior and
34:45 uh who were experts and I just asked as
34:48 many questions as I could and never
34:51 afraid to just ask stupid questions and
34:53 repeat questions if I needed to until
34:55 until it made sense. And then sometimes
34:57 if I had the basic knowledge, I had
34:58 something that I wanted to understand, I
35:00 would go and just research it online.
35:02 And there are a lot of good um
35:04 increasingly actually a lot of really
35:06 good like blog posts um
35:09 um newsletters um that are available and
35:13 I think increasingly there are more and
35:15 more resources that are lot a lot more
35:17 like accessible um for people who
35:19 haven't necessarily studied like
35:21 computer science or like data science or
35:23 um statistics or this these sorts of
35:26 subjects at university.
35:28 You didn't study that right did you? No,
35:31 I studied classics which is Latin and
35:34 ancient Greek. [laughter]
35:36 That was your um education.
35:39 That was my bachelor. Yeah.
35:40 Yeah.
35:42 You speak anxious Greek and Latin.
35:44 No, I I read I can read it.
35:48 Interesting.
35:49 Yeah.
35:49 Okay. That uh this just made our
35:52 interview even more interesting.
35:54 [laughter]
35:55 like how do you go from you know uh
35:58 [clears throat] studying ancient Greek
36:01 and Latin to being an analytics
36:03 engineer? So you learned basically
36:04 everything you needed yourself, right?
36:07 Yeah, exactly. So um
36:09 by yourself I mean not as a part of any
36:12 official curriculum.
36:14 Yeah, I did a um to be honest I did this
36:19 SQL course on Udemy that cost me €12 and
36:23 it was great. It was really, really
36:25 good. It was quite long. Um, but the the
36:28 guy I can't remember, I think it was
36:30 just called the complete guide to SQL
36:32 and it's run by this American dude
36:34 called Colt Steel. It's just a very
36:36 strange name. He's got a loads of he's
36:38 got like a good Python course as well
36:39 that I did. And I just did that in my
36:41 spare time. And to be honest, I was just
36:44 it was really great that it was cost me
36:46 all of€12. And I haven't done a single
36:48 other SQL course um since. Um, so I do
36:53 sometimes sometimes I do like think, oh,
36:57 like should I go and pay for one of
36:59 these like fancy courses and like data
37:01 science or something? Um, because it's
37:04 nice to kind of have structure and and
37:06 whatnot. But then I'm like, if I just
37:08 motivated myself, I could do it for like
37:11 two pounds. [gasps and laughter] Uh,
37:13 there's so much stuff online. Um, but
37:15 it's just a case of I think I was quite
37:16 lucky to find a good course right away.
37:18 I think there are some not very good
37:20 courses out there, but um so it's a
37:23 little bit of hit and miss, but I think
37:25 that's one thing that's really great
37:26 about um well, I guess software
37:29 engineering in general and and computer
37:31 science is that you if you don't have a
37:33 lot of resources, you can really teach
37:35 yourself. Um there's a lot of um
37:37 resources online, but at the same time,
37:39 as I said, like practicing is really the
37:41 thing that makes the the difference. And
37:43 I was very lucky that I was already at a
37:46 company that I knew the domain like very
37:48 well, business model very well, KPIs. So
37:52 I kind of had all of that already
37:53 covered um and could just focus on
37:56 developing like the SQL skills and data
37:59 modeling etc. I can imagine that someone
38:02 who is maybe approaching this as a
38:04 career change um and maybe taking some
38:07 time out to do it, it's a little bit
38:09 more difficult because you don't have
38:11 that context of a specific business or a
38:14 specific uh problem or um yeah that you
38:18 can kind of hold in your mind as you
38:21 think about these problems and have an
38:23 example that you can apply
38:25 apply the theory to. Yeah, there's a
38:28 thing called just in time learning and I
38:30 think you took this to to the extreme,
38:32 right? So without any formal education
38:34 in computer science or analytics, you
38:37 just focused on a specific problem which
38:39 in your case was marketing, right? And
38:40 then you okay like how do I I don't know
38:44 set up looker to do this thing.
38:46 By the way, do you are your tasks that
38:49 you do now are they still more or less
38:51 related to marketing? So you mentioned
38:53 this uh RFM analysis, right? I think
38:55 it's still somewhat related, right?
38:58 Um, not really to be honest. No, I think
39:01 at the moment I'm really working very
39:03 closely with the product
39:04 team. So, it's really around but you
39:06 know eventually ultimately
39:09 um yeah we are focusing on yeah growing
39:14 um acquiring more users, retaining more
39:16 users which are all of course interlin
39:19 um goals with the marketing team. So
39:20 nothing is is not super
39:23 um not not directly relevant but yeah my
39:26 stake my direct stakeholders are the
39:28 product managers.
39:30 Okay. So I guess your
39:34 background in marketing really helped
39:35 you.
39:36 Yeah it really really it really did. Um
39:39 I really really notice how
39:43 just in everyday work I really think
39:46 that I do there I definitely see an
39:49 edge. um that I have because I'm very
39:52 comfortable with the
39:54 you know things like a marketing funnel
39:56 and um a conversion funnel, a web
39:59 acquisition funnel. These are things
40:00 that for example um a product manager
40:03 might be focusing specifically on a on a
40:05 part of a funnel or or a whole funnel uh
40:08 as part of the user journey.
40:10 And as a marketing person, you kind of
40:13 think about the user journey all the
40:15 time. You know, what are the touch
40:16 points of the user? How do they feel at
40:18 this moment? what are they thinking at
40:19 this moment? What have they done? Where
40:20 have they come from? So you I kind of
40:23 you have this
40:25 quite close um I guess empathy with the
40:30 with the user and specifically the
40:32 journey, but at the same time your goals
40:34 marketing are to kind of you know
40:35 constantly optimize and grow and get
40:38 more users or higher retention or um you
40:41 know more signups or whatever it might
40:42 might be. So you have this mindset as
40:44 well, this growth mindset um that I
40:47 think is a is very useful when you come
40:50 to um advising uh people from like a
40:53 data point of view because you can ask
40:54 the question like okay but yes you got
40:57 some good feedback from the the users on
40:58 this feature but um you know ultimately
41:02 the top line hasn't like moved at all
41:04 and we we did this because we wanted to
41:06 grow you know whatever this KPI is. Mhm.
41:09 So I think it um yeah it definitely does
41:13 does help uh largely in the in the realm
41:15 of like understanding the user journey
41:17 and it means that you can you can really
41:20 hold in your head like this user um
41:23 perspective but also the data
41:24 perspective together and like kind of
41:26 advise with those two things in your
41:28 head. Mhm. And if somebody wants to
41:32 follow your journey for somebody's
41:34 working in marketing or maybe not
41:37 necessarily in marketing but they really
41:39 want to go into data and do start doing
41:42 analytics engineering and they are
41:44 domain experts in their domain right so
41:47 what kind of thing would you suggest
41:48 them to do
41:50 so firstly I would say um Excel is your
41:54 best friend I mean Excel is great
41:58 ultimately it doesn't get I mean I
42:00 Everyone hates it, but it really doesn't
42:02 get the credit it deserves. I mean, I
42:05 still have people in the company who
42:08 really um should and don't know how to
42:11 use a make a pivot table and they are
42:13 quite annoying to make in Excel. Like
42:15 the most difficult pivot table you make
42:17 will be in Excel. And if you can do it
42:18 there and be comfortable and understand
42:21 what's happening with columns and rows,
42:24 it's that's the first place to go. So,
42:26 be really really comfortable with Excel.
42:28 play around with functions. Um, pivot
42:31 tables.
42:32 Um,
42:34 just explore explore it. Looking at
42:37 different ways of trying to, you know,
42:39 take a data set that you feel
42:40 comfortable with. It might just be
42:41 something really simple like daily
42:45 signups and by country and just in Excel
42:49 start playing around with that and
42:51 asking questions. And then of course
42:52 SQL, the most important thing. Um, learn
42:56 SQL. try and find online. There are some
42:59 data sets that you can play around with
43:01 and kind of practice the SQL and
43:04 um that's really really useful. Um,
43:08 but ultimately I think what
43:12 where I found a little bit of a gap in
43:14 the in the self-learning was between the
43:16 online SQL resources and like
43:19 finding like advanced SQL queries that
43:24 made sense that weren't written by
43:26 someone on the other side of the world
43:27 about a company that had no connection
43:29 to, didn't understand a business model.
43:31 and was written in a way that for
43:33 example wasn't the style that was going
43:35 to be written in my team. So ended up
43:37 just being a little bit confusing and
43:39 extra work to try and understand. So if
43:43 there's a way to access like some of the
43:45 SQL code the VI were using maybe you can
43:47 ask them to share like you know a couple
43:50 of um SQL queries they use to make the
43:53 main tables or that's definitely
43:56 something to to do if your company is
43:59 using Looker. There's a great um that's
44:03 amazing like to get familiar with that
44:05 really just start building building this
44:08 from dashboards explores become really
44:10 comfortable with filtering pivoting
44:13 those sorts of things. There's a lot of
44:15 resources as well online from Looker and
44:17 I think also I think the Tableau as well
44:21 um or whatever visualization tool you're
44:23 using it doesn't really matter just I
44:25 think become comfortable with the basic
44:27 basic kind of features of those um yeah
44:30 those would be the main things I think
44:32 and then go from there I think also find
44:34 someone who can be your if not mentor
44:38 kind of your champion or someone that
44:40 you can uh an ally I in the data team
44:45 and ask them, you know, what what do
44:47 what do I need to do? What uh what
44:51 skills are still missing? How do I do
44:53 them? Like, do you think it's possible?
44:54 Ask them what they would um recommend if
44:59 you're in an existing company and you're
45:00 looking to move to that department. Um
45:04 yeah, I think that would be kind of my
45:07 my suggestion. How important do you
45:09 think to have this mentor or champion in
45:12 this journey like for you from what I
45:15 understood it was quite important was
45:17 crucial right that person it was a
45:20 marketing analyst if I remember
45:21 correctly right she helped you like she
45:24 said you what she told you what you
45:26 should do like what kind of things you
45:28 should focus on and then she also was
45:31 helpful for you to actually transition
45:33 to the team
45:34 exactly she was um she was the B she was
45:36 the BI analyst the data analyst the only
45:38 one that we had at the time. I think
45:40 actually sorry we had two people in the
45:42 data team and she was one of them. Um
45:45 for me it was very useful and important.
45:48 I think to be honest though it depends
45:51 it depends on on the company your
45:53 position in the company how comfortable
45:55 you feel, what level of kind of like
45:57 power so to speak you have in the
45:59 company. Um and also I mean for me as a
46:03 woman I think you know transitioning
46:06 from marketing into a more technical um
46:11 role I was going to move to the
46:12 engineering department.
46:14 There was immediately I felt an element
46:17 of I don't know a lot of uh what's the
46:20 word um
46:23 um the syndrome imposter imposter
46:27 syndrome I thought oh what am I doing
46:28 like can I really do this and I think it
46:30 really helped me to have another um yeah
46:35 a female basically um mentor to um to
46:41 kind of champion me and encourage me and
46:44 say yeah you can do this like definitely
46:46 you can do this like you just need to do
46:48 this and this and like you can
46:49 definitely do that once you've done that
46:50 like come and you can find a way so it
46:54 depends I think if you have a lot of
46:55 motivation and you're very clear on what
46:57 you want and you're confident um then I
47:01 don't think it's necessarily needed but
47:04 particularly for minorities
47:07 um especially I think also in um there's
47:11 a lot of kind
47:14 support groups like outside of like uh
47:17 you know there's PI ladies and lots of
47:19 different um uh various support groups
47:22 for minorities in tech which are great
47:24 to be inspired by but I think having
47:27 that one person in your company uh who
47:29 you can relate to um can can be really
47:33 helpful just in terms of building up
47:35 your own confidence
47:37 um and it's definitely something that
47:39 helped me also to not just transition
47:42 into the team but you know once I was in
47:45 the team kind of accelerate quite
47:48 quickly because yes I was junior when I
47:51 joined but my career path up to being a
47:55 mid-level analyst and now sort of
47:57 interant team lead was a lot quicker
48:00 because
48:01 I had to fight and be like well I have
48:02 been doing analytics work for years
48:04 before I haven't actually picked all of
48:06 this up from scratch and sort of having
48:08 to like have the confidence to to make
48:11 that clear and argue it and um yeah it
48:15 was really helpful having someone to
48:17 basically champion. So I would recommend
48:19 finding one person in that company who
48:21 can kind of be that for you.
48:24 Yeah. Did you did you take any did you
48:27 take part in any of these support group
48:29 that you mentioned like p ladies or did
48:31 you have mentors or people who you
48:34 constantly talk to outside of the
48:36 company or it was mostly that person and
48:38 the rest of the team that you
48:42 kind of talk to to learn?
48:43 Yeah, in my case it was mainly um my two
48:48 two teammates um who were the BI team
48:51 when I joined. They were incredible, so
48:53 supportive. They really um encouraged me
48:57 a lot and yeah have helped me hugely and
49:00 were very excited for me to join and the
49:03 team and yeah and made me feel very
49:07 welcome and like I I deserve to be there
49:09 which was uh yeah very useful because at
49:12 times I was like oh am I doing it like
49:14 is this too hard? Um
49:17 but in terms of external support, not
49:19 really to be honest. I had a few friends
49:22 who also worked in um two very close
49:25 friends who worked in data who yeah it
49:27 was nice to talk to them and have their
49:30 advice as well and have different
49:31 perspectives from different companies
49:32 which I think is something that um
49:36 particularly as someone who's been at a
49:37 company for a very long time. I
49:38 definitely feel the need to speak to
49:41 people in different places and see like
49:42 oh is it also like this where you work
49:44 or like is this a specific issue like
49:48 just that we're facing or is this a
49:50 general thing and having that
49:52 perspective has also been really useful
49:54 um in order to just sort of like
49:55 benchmark certain issues that you come
49:58 across. Um, so yeah, I wish I actually
50:01 had a I think having a few more external
50:05 I think um mentors or support would
50:09 would be yeah great. I think probably in
50:12 the coming year I'll probably look for a
50:14 mentor um just to to kind of help with
50:18 like kicking off the next phase
50:21 development but yeah we'll see. Do you
50:23 have any ideas where you can look for
50:25 these sort of um mentors? Like would it
50:28 be conferences, Meetup groups or I don't
50:30 know
50:31 some place online?
50:32 Yeah, probably a combination of LinkedIn
50:37 I mean first the network. So asking yeah
50:40 asking people that I know if they have
50:42 anyone they recommend. Uh and then yeah
50:45 meetups as well I think is probably the
50:48 a good way to go. Is there an analytics
50:51 engineer engineering meetup in Berlin?
50:56 I'm not sure. There's definitely like a
50:58 snowplow um meetup that I think has just
51:01 started up again. We're about to
51:05 um
51:06 then yeah, in terms of analytics
51:09 engineering, I'm not sure to be honest.
51:11 I don't
51:13 don't think so. I know there are some
51:14 data meetups. Um I'm not sure if they're
51:17 specifically analytics engineering. Um I
51:20 have kept an eye open on so I like on
51:23 the DBT Slack group which is extensive
51:27 and actually great. Um yeah they have
51:31 like uh some city specific groups and
51:34 Berlin has yet to uh I think make its
51:36 appearance. So perhaps in the future
51:38 there might be like a DBT Berlin.
51:41 Yeah I think there should be. So, one of
51:43 the uh people who helped me with the
51:46 questions is Victoria. So, Victoria was
51:48 a guest on this podcast like more than a
51:50 year ago and now she works at DBT and I
51:53 think she's she is or will be organizing
51:56 something soon I think.
51:57 Oh, nice.
51:58 Maybe maybe she will tell us.
52:01 Um I see that it's almost uh yeah, it's
52:05 almost time to finish. So, I wanted to
52:07 ask you last one last thing. So you
52:10 mentioned that you are subscribed to
52:12 some newsletters. So there are good blog
52:14 posts, good newsletters and these
52:17 newsletters are quite useful for you. Uh
52:20 what kind of newsletters are you
52:21 subscribed to? So if I want to
52:24 keep an eye on what's happening in this
52:27 in this area, what kind of newsletters
52:29 do I subscribe to?
52:32 Uh it's a good question. There's one I
52:33 think I'm subscribed to
52:36 analytics engineering one that's called
52:37 like the route. I think it's the I think
52:39 it might be the DBT one. I think it's
52:41 called like the roundup or something.
52:44 Um, analytics engineering roundup.
52:48 Um, I think it's I think it's I think it
52:50 might be the DBT actually newsletter. I
52:53 think [snorts]
52:54 um there's another one I just subscribed
52:57 to like a week or two ago that's called
53:00 um Lenny's newsletter. Um
53:04 Lenny's newsletter. So, it's Lenny is a
53:06 name octopus
53:08 L E N Y. Um, and I don't
53:12 um I've only just subscribed to it
53:14 recently. I think it was slightly more
53:15 like kind of product um analytics
53:18 focused. Um and then the
53:23 there is a blog that I'm sure most of
53:27 your readers will know. I've just
53:28 forgotten the name of it. It's like
53:31 it's got a like profoundly optimistic or
53:34 something. It's called
53:35 locally local.
53:36 Locally optimistic. Yeah,
53:38 that one.
53:38 Yeah, they have a like community too.
53:41 Yeah, that um yeah, from time to time
53:44 I'll check their that
53:46 profoundly optimistic is also a good
53:48 name.
53:48 Yeah, [laughter]
53:50 it's even better I think.
53:53 [laughter]
53:53 Okay, so if somebody has questions uh
53:57 for you, how can they find you? Is it
53:59 LinkedIn or you have some other there
54:02 are some other ways to contact you?
54:03 Um yeah, LinkedIn would be best. They
54:05 can just message me directly on there.
54:08 Okay, Nikki, thank you very much. Thanks
