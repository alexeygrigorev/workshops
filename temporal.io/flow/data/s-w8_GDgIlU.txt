1:50 person and we have a special guest today
1:53 Carmen and u Carmen and I are actually
1:57 colleagues ex-col
1:59 worked with me at Elix as a senior data
2:01 scientist then at some point he left
2:03 Elix joined entrepreneur first which is
2:06 I think uh like a startup factory sort
2:09 of so so to say and now he's a co-ound
2:12 founder and CTO at Freshflow. So,
2:15 welcome.
2:16 Thank you. Thank you, Alexi. I'm glad
2:18 that you could invite me and I could see
2:19 you again. Um, so yeah, um, great uh,
2:23 great introduction uh, just to get to
2:26 know me a little bit better. So, I
2:27 started um, basically programming when I
2:29 was a kid at the age of five. Um, and
2:32 then I continued this passion like my
2:35 entire life and uh, obviously I went to
2:37 university. I think I I felt quite um
2:41 you know um fortunate that I could
2:43 actually know what I wanted to do uh in
2:46 university. I know a lot of people
2:47 struggle with that. Uh I went directly
2:49 to uh computer science and did computer
2:52 science
2:53 um uh bachelor in uh University of
2:56 Bolognia and did also like uh some gigs
3:00 as a freelance web developer uh for
3:02 around a year and uh then I published my
3:05 thesis uh also in a book uh which is the
3:09 name of the thesis is called large scale
3:10 social network analysis. It was about
3:14 how to parallelize uh social network
3:16 analysis algorithms using uh NPI lot of
3:19 C++. I'm glad that I don't have to do
3:21 that again. Um but it was really fun. If
3:23 you want to check it out is published on
3:25 Springer. Um and then I joined my master
3:29 in um university uh free university of
3:32 of uh Amsterdam uh which was in
3:35 artificial intelligence and then since
3:37 then I just fell in love with it and uh
3:39 continued doing data science for five
3:41 years including at Ox at another
3:43 consultancy before and uh at another
3:46 startup before and then after Ox
3:49 uh well during Ox actually I went to Ox
3:51 squared which is the moonshot team of Ox
3:54 where you can innovate as as much as you
3:56 want. Um and then after that I joined
3:59 the data science for social good at the
4:01 Alanering Institute which is a research
4:04 institution uh in the UK uh for data
4:07 science and machine learning. Um so
4:09 mentored some students there and we
4:10 helped the World Bank and uh Offstead
4:14 which is the office of standards for
4:16 early years childcare in the UK uh with
4:19 uh some really exciting data analytics
4:22 uh which maybe I can show later. And uh
4:25 after that I uh decided to join
4:27 entrepreneur first but of course the
4:29 story doesn't doesn't start like that
4:31 right uh you just don't want to start a
4:33 company from the one day to another.
4:36 Yeah. So I also have a five like you you
4:39 said you started programming as a five
4:41 year old kid and my kid now is 5year-old
4:44 so maybe in another uh some other time
4:47 I'll pick your brain how to actually
4:49 teach him a bit of programming. Uh, it
4:51 just has to be really not excited about
4:53 watching TV. That was I think that was
4:55 the key.
4:57 Interesting. Not the case.
5:01 Everybody's on.
5:04 Okay. Um, yeah. So, tell us a bit about
5:07 your stuff startup. What do you do
5:09 there?
5:09 Sure. So, um, as you said, I'm a
5:12 co-founder CTO of Freshflow. Uh,
5:13 Freshflow is a complete ordering system
5:17 for supermarkets. And what we want to
5:20 solve is the enormous food waste problem
5:22 that we have in the world. So uh and
5:26 also make more money for supermarkets
5:28 and make more money for us. So we have
5:30 this really nice triple bottom line uh
5:32 which makes us a profitable business.
5:34 Well not yet but we will in the future
5:36 hopefully and also will make more money
5:38 for for the supermarkets and benefit the
5:40 the planet. So the problem that we saw
5:44 uh and especially um Avik saw actually
5:47 when which is my co-founder which when
5:49 uh he was trying to sell to supermarkets
5:54 um another solution which was based on
5:56 uh computer vision he saw that actually
5:59 a bigger problem that they used to have
6:01 and they still have is what to order
6:04 exactly especially for fresh products.
6:06 So the problem with fresh products is
6:08 that they have varying shelf lives. Um
6:11 and there's highly variable shelf lives.
6:14 So even the same I don't know type of
6:17 product like mangoes uh one batch could
6:19 have like a week left another batch
6:23 could have like two days left. Um and it
6:26 is really really hard to predict all of
6:27 that and to predict how many you need at
6:30 what time etc etc. But uh most
6:33 supermarkets we found that uh they still
6:35 use people on the floor. So there are
6:37 like so-called fresh product managers
6:40 that they actually every single day they
6:42 spend two hours looking at the shelves
6:45 and looking at what they have in the
6:47 back uh to figure out what they actually
6:49 have to order. And um we when we started
6:53 our pilot our first pilot with uh with
6:55 Edica uh here which is the largest
6:58 German supermarket. If anyone is
7:00 watching from
7:01 you have a pilot with them. That's
7:02 that's awesome.
7:03 Yeah. With one uh one store right now
7:06 and they we're signing with other stores
7:09 uh
7:10 so that's cool.
7:10 Uh in the future. Yeah. Uh and uh yeah
7:14 we we went there we did user research
7:16 which is a thing that uh um actually we
7:18 learned at ox squared. It was a great
7:20 experience there uh working with the
7:22 designers from coast. Um
7:25 and um
7:28 we saw that the fresh product people uh
7:31 they go there at 6:00 a.m. in the
7:33 morning. Uh they have a lot of like
7:35 boxes to move around. Uh and then once
7:38 they move around all these boxes
7:40 uh which takes a couple of hours uh they
7:43 put all the things in place and then
7:45 they start the ordering process for the
7:47 next day. So they have to calculate what
7:49 is going to be the demand you know the
7:51 next day they have to think about it in
7:53 their head they have to think about
7:54 weather they have to think about uh
7:56 seasonality differences uh is for
7:59 example I don't know is there a big
8:01 event in the in the town uh in the
8:04 specific town where we're doing the
8:05 pilot for example there is a big like um
8:09 ramp let's say uh to go to the to the
8:12 supermarket and if that ramp for example
8:14 is full of snow will go to the
8:17 supermarket. So all of these kind of
8:18 things in their heads for 200 products.
8:21 It's insane. It is really an incredible
8:23 work and I'm amazed actually that that
8:26 works at all. Uh so they're doing a
8:29 great job. But of course, you know, as
8:32 we are humans and we're not we're not
8:34 calculators. Uh so basically we create
8:37 um ordering system uh that it lives in
8:40 an iPad app for all they know.
8:43 Lives mostly in the cloud to be honest.
8:45 uh which uh uses machine learning and
8:48 reinforcement learning actually.
8:49 Oh wow.
8:50 Uh to to figure out the perfect order.
8:54 Oh, cool. So I heard that this uh
8:56 position is called fresh product
8:58 manager, right? So I know uh product
9:01 managers what they do at Elix. So it's a
9:03 different kind of product manager,
9:05 right?
9:05 Absolutely.
9:06 Manage actually manage manage pro
9:08 products, right?
9:09 Yeah. It's a lot less about politics and
9:11 a lot more about what is what how many
9:15 uh strawberries you have to order for
9:17 the next
9:17 basically every store in every company
9:21 like every supermarket they have this
9:23 sort of position right so they have to
9:24 wake up at 6:00 a.m. in the morning they
9:26 have to do go like around look at the
9:30 shelves and see okay like these mangoes
9:33 are getting spoiled we need to do
9:34 something about them right they do this
9:37 every day and uh it's a lot of manual
9:39 work they also have to uh you know wake
9:42 up early while I guess everyone is uh at
9:45 home still like before the shop opens
9:47 right
9:48 yeah exactly it's a very tough work uh
9:50 we were amazed that uh uh you know the
9:53 were these these ladies that could do
9:55 that um at that early in the morning and
10:00 also keep fresh to you know think about
10:02 all these other factors and uh honestly
10:05 we were struggling with me my co-ounder
10:07 to follow them they were so fast uh it
10:10 was it was really amazing really amazing
10:11 so you was you were just sitting with
10:13 them watching how they work and then
10:15 trying to replicate it
10:17 uh yeah we were shadowing them uh for a
10:19 couple of days so we went there for a
10:21 week um this is actually how we work in
10:24 general it's called design thinking. So
10:26 uh we do a few steps that you see in the
10:29 design thinking uh methodologies. There
10:31 are many design thinking methodologies.
10:33 Uh so uh we follow usually from my
10:37 experience with the ox squared and with
10:39 the book uh design thinking by cure
10:43 highly recommended by the way uh and it
10:45 also it's very much appreciated uh by
10:48 our clients that we do that because uh
10:50 we are able to really figure out what
10:53 are the processes how things go on in
10:56 the store and then deliver the solution
10:58 that they actually need instead of that
10:59 we think they need which is a big
11:02 learning that I had from from from that
11:03 experience in X squ um and also to be
11:06 honest from from EF uh they also push
11:08 another book which is really interesting
11:09 which I also recommend it's called the
11:12 mom test I would say it's a much lighter
11:14 version of design thinking um and uh
11:18 it's mostly to gather towards um you
11:22 know entrepreneurs and to do how to do
11:24 sales calls and stuff like that. Uh but
11:27 it does help you figure out what to ask
11:30 and you want to ask things that actually
11:33 make the user tell you uh all their
11:35 processes and not tell you the solution
11:37 that they want. Uh because between what
11:40 they want and what they need, there's
11:41 always like a bit of a difference to be
11:43 honest.
11:43 Mhm. Okay. Interesting. And uh I don't
11:47 think you just woke up one day and
11:49 realized okay there is this problem uh
11:52 let's just you know uh leave for elix
11:55 and solve it right so there probably
11:57 something happened like uh so I'm
12:00 curious how did you actually come uh up
12:03 with this idea what did the process look
12:06 like? Yeah, it was uh very interesting.
12:09 So, I joined entrepreneur first because
12:11 I wanted to be uh I wanted to have a
12:14 startup. Uh this was a desire that I had
12:16 since I was in my bachelor but I never
12:19 really thought
12:20 you didn't know what exactly you'll do,
12:22 right?
12:22 Yeah, exactly. There's there were a few
12:24 ideas that I had um but I didn't I I
12:28 tried to like um have some people and
12:32 try to ideulate with some people and
12:34 maybe come up with some some uh I don't
12:36 know ideas for a startup and stuff but
12:39 um in the end it didn't really
12:41 materialize. Um shout out to Shander as
12:43 well.
12:45 And uh the the problem is that you're
12:49 always so busy. So uh we were trying
12:51 during you know also having a job at the
12:54 same time and um uh it was it was really
12:58 hard. Um you need to really dedicate
13:00 your life to it and to find like what is
13:03 a what is a good idea unless you have a
13:05 good idea already. Uh and also like to
13:07 find a co-founder is really hard that
13:08 also has the same amount of time and the
13:10 same like life circumstances.
13:13 Um and so in the end uh when I received
13:17 the call from entrepreneur first I
13:20 didn't know about them and this was
13:21 around February when I was in Olex
13:23 squared in February 2020. Um and uh I
13:28 was already um I already uh got the
13:32 position at the Alening Institute at the
13:34 time. So I was uh really keen on like
13:37 first doing these two things because
13:38 they were so cool. uh and they told me
13:40 that actually uh the other cohort uh
13:43 would start in September and that would
13:45 be exactly in line with uh with the rest
13:47 of my timeline. So I thought that's
13:49 perfect fine. Um so I reapplied uh then
13:53 for the September cohort uh got in and
13:56 um yeah I had like an amazing time to be
13:58 honest. Um so in entrepreneur first is
14:02 really interesting because they so the
14:04 tagline is the word um leader talent
14:07 investor um so the they call themselves
14:11 talent investor because essentially they
14:12 take you in because you don't have you
14:15 have the potential to be a co-founder
14:17 because of your career path what you did
14:20 in the past is quite interesting the uh
14:22 the growth that you have is pretty uh
14:24 big uh or you I don't know know
14:27 something very specific that nobody else
14:28 knows. in the world
14:31 and um
14:33 uh they basically take a bunch of people
14:35 like that in the same like space. Uh
14:38 they give you a bunch of talks on how to
14:39 do sales, how to do uh marketing, how to
14:43 this uh like this is something that
14:45 technical people like you, like me, we
14:48 usually don't know these things, right?
14:50 We don't know how to
14:52 uh like marketing is a I have no idea
14:55 like what marketing people do, right? So
14:57 it's pretty nice of them that they uh
15:00 also teach you um these things.
15:03 Yeah, absolutely. Uh they have like they
15:06 have experts that uh they are either
15:08 called in or they're already in
15:10 entrepreneur first. Um for example for
15:13 sales um like guys that exited companies
15:16 for many many times they're are venture
15:17 partners there uh because essentially
15:19 it's a ultimately it's a kind of venture
15:21 capital um for preede companies but they
15:25 operate quite differently and uh so they
15:28 have uh these venture partners that are
15:29 very experienced and they will talk
15:30 about these these topics uh absolutely
15:33 recommended. Uh there were even talks by
15:36 um Ben Evans for example which is one of
15:38 the uh best um people in the VC space.
15:42 Uh he used to be uh at uh Andress on
15:45 Auroritz as well.
15:46 He's now a global venture partner there.
15:49 Uh and many other people that are
15:50 perhaps less known but uh really really
15:52 good.
15:54 Yeah.
15:54 Interesting.
15:55 So
15:56 So they put you through this training,
15:57 right? Yeah. But I guess that's not the
15:59 only thing they do, right?
16:01 No, no, no, no. Of course. uh well they
16:06 um they assist you with like some sort
16:09 of um framework on how to find a
16:12 co-founder. So first of all you go there
16:14 and you kind of know if you're a CTO
16:16 type or a CEO type even though like
16:19 there may be some uh exception spoiler
16:21 alert. Um so
16:25 usually um you know if you if you have a
16:28 technical background you're a CTO type
16:29 if you have a more businessminded
16:31 background or a domain edge what they
16:33 call it uh you're a CEO type
16:36 and data scientist maybe would be a CTO
16:38 and product manager would be a CEO
16:40 roughly
16:41 yeah roughly absolutely um it could also
16:45 change
16:46 um but uh let's see let's go there later
16:49 so
16:50 the idea is that they have so-called
16:53 edges and uh you fit in one or two
16:56 edges. Um so the edges that uh EF has
17:01 are um catalyst edge uh domain edge and
17:05 technical edge. And so uh catalyst edge
17:09 they're actually further defined as
17:10 catalyst doers and catalyst talkers. So
17:13 the catalyst doers are the ones that are
17:15 very energetic. Uh they can make
17:18 basically almost anything. uh they don't
17:21 have like a specific technical edge that
17:24 is so sharp that only like 10 people in
17:27 the world have uh but they're more
17:29 widespread like data science for example
17:31 would be
17:31 full stack person right
17:32 full stack person uh us for example
17:35 we're catalyst doers for for EF
17:39 um and catalyst talkers are like you
17:43 know flexible business people
17:44 essentially right so they kind kind of
17:46 the same thing but on the business side
17:48 uh and then there are domain edges
17:51 And domain edges are basically people
17:53 that have very very specific in-depth
17:56 knowledge of a specific domain. Um so
17:59 for example one of my uh let's say
18:01 co-founders so at the time we were
18:04 starting uh a company with him uh with
18:07 UNF
18:09 um he had deep expertise in the pharma
18:12 space. So he worked he was a general
18:14 manager at uh Definians which then got
18:17 acquired by Astroenica
18:19 uh and then he worked there for like 20
18:21 years uh absolute master about um you
18:25 know computer vision in pharma and
18:28 that's a definite domain edge and then
18:31 tech edges are people that have very
18:34 very specific skills in uh something uh
18:37 in some tech uh so for example there was
18:39 a guy that did this PhD thesis on 3D
18:42 printing uh human hearts. Like I don't
18:45 know that many people that do that.
18:48 That's as specific as it can get, right?
18:50 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Um yeah, shout
18:54 out to Martin uh and and Javier
18:57 and uh yeah um they give you this
19:00 framework in order to start the
19:03 conversation with the other people. So
19:05 then if you are let's say a domain edge,
19:08 you would definitely talk about your
19:09 domain.
19:11 Um, if you're a tech edge, you
19:13 definitely talk about that specific uh
19:15 thing. If you're a catalyst, it's a bit
19:17 more fluffy. You talk about what you are
19:20 most uh expert at and um see what are
19:25 the inter interweaving uh threads that
19:28 you can find with the other people.
19:31 Uh and yeah, they're very interesting
19:34 conversations. So, it's it's really like
19:35 one of the best times ever. Um you can
19:39 talk about crazy things from one day to
19:42 another. you can have like 10
19:43 conversation in one day where they span
19:45 between uh I don't know like how to
19:48 solve the climate issue uh to I don't
19:51 know how to make uh specific dashboard
19:54 for fintech companies you know there
19:56 could be anything in between and so you
19:58 also go with your own gut feeling trying
20:00 to see who you think you will fit with
20:04 um and what kind of like what kind of
20:07 ideas are you most drawn to and then of
20:09 course you bring your own ideas uh and
20:12 and you see you test them a little bit
20:14 and then they have mentors uh which
20:16 every single week they have a call with
20:19 you so there are two mentors actually
20:21 one is the let's call it the
20:23 relationship mentor so you can ask about
20:26 hey what what what can I how can I
20:28 approach people between that or uh I
20:31 don't know like um my current co-founder
20:34 I don't know there's something wrong
20:36 with our relationship how can we fix it
20:38 uh and um then the other mentor which
20:41 you that only if you have a team. Um
20:44 it's uh it's a quite experienced usually
20:48 in the startup space. Um
20:51 and it will tell you a lot about like uh
20:54 what are you doing good or what are you
20:56 doing wrong in terms of like uh market
20:58 sizing uh figuring out if the idea has
21:01 any chance of of working essentially. Uh
21:04 and they give you a score also every
21:06 single week which is between 1 and four
21:09 um which tells you more or less like how
21:12 they think you're going to do at the
21:15 final examination
21:17 uh which is called investment committee
21:20 which is in uh January. So this entire
21:23 thing starts in September in January
21:25 then uh you you're in the investment
21:28 committee and actually I should say this
21:29 is divided in few phases. So the first
21:32 phase is called the form phase which is
21:34 I think eight weeks and uh the form
21:38 phase is the phase where you try to find
21:39 your co-founder
21:41 uh and then after the form phase you
21:44 just have to say this is my co-founder
21:46 and then you can pass through the uh
21:48 company building phase and then the
21:50 company building phase basically you
21:52 have to prepare all the material that
21:53 you need for the investment committee
21:55 and the investment committee is a bunch
21:57 of venture partners from from EF and we
21:59 had actually Benedict Deans in our
22:02 committee uh amongst others.
22:05 Uh so it it was a bit uh intimidating
22:08 but it was very very helpful and very u
22:11 very useful for us also in the future.
22:14 Fortunately we passed. So
22:15 yeah so they decide basically if they
22:17 want to invest or not right that's the
22:18 finalation.
22:20 That's the final examination. Yeah.
22:21 Yeah. And if they want to invest they
22:23 you know you get money. If they don't
22:26 then
22:26 then bye-bye.
22:28 But I guess some people still try to
22:30 pursue their idea, right? Just to find
22:33 other way to to like find other
22:37 investors, right?
22:38 Yeah. Yeah. Um so some other people that
22:41 didn't get investments, they got uh
22:43 other grants or they were incubated in
22:46 other incubators uh or they went for
22:48 competitors of EVF like
22:50 Entler. Um so in the end, you know, if
22:53 you want if you want it, you can do it.
22:56 That's a that's a big lesson actually.
22:58 You you mentioned that your co-founder
23:00 has experience in pharma right
23:04 that was my previous co-founder. So we I
23:06 had a few teams in EF um um and uh my
23:11 current co-founder which is I should say
23:13 the co-founder because it's my
23:15 co-founder uh and it was not just a team
23:18 uh in EF uh is actually a machine
23:21 learning scientist also
23:23 uh similar background um much younger
23:25 he's 26 uh he just graduated from ETH
23:29 Zurich and uh he was actually quite
23:31 active in the uh entrepreneur space so
23:34 he founded I think This is now his third
23:36 company.
23:37 Oh, which
23:37 is quite insane at 26. So
23:39 yes,
23:40 shout out to AIC.
23:42 Awesome.
23:43 More insane is programming at five for
23:49 Thanks, man. I hope that all of these
23:50 credentials will come up in
23:54 in our products. Um so yeah, he's uh
23:58 he's also very impressive in that sense.
24:00 Um and um it he founded a company in um
24:05 uh motion analysis uh then another one
24:08 in uh cryptocurrency in China actually
24:11 while he was studying and now Freshflow
24:13 as well and he's the CEO so he's
24:15 handling the business um side uh and we
24:19 decided like that just because uh I I
24:21 think uh it fits more with what our our
24:24 backgrounds are so like um I have uh
24:27 longer uh technical experience and he
24:30 has longer entrepreneurial experience.
24:32 So I think it's just it just works and
24:33 it's great to have a technical
24:34 co-founder. So we were kind of also the
24:36 exception. That's why I said spoiler
24:38 alert before.
24:39 Yeah. And I see already we have quite a
24:41 few questions in live chat and uh I am
24:44 wondering so one question from Medi is
24:46 uh how when and why this idea of your
24:50 business come to your mind because from
24:52 what I understood about your co-founder
24:54 he's also not like he doesn't strike me
24:56 like as a person who spent his life in
24:59 uh you know overseeing the supermarket
25:02 right
25:03 so how did you actually get this idea
25:06 yeah that's a good question so um as I
25:09 said before, he was developing this um
25:12 um computer vision product recognition
25:15 uh thing um during his thesis and um he
25:21 basically started to sell it to
25:23 different supermarkets.
25:25 He started to have calls with different
25:26 supermarkets being entrepreneurial
25:28 minded as he is, right?
25:30 uh and uh during these calls uh he
25:32 realized that actually there is a lot of
25:34 there are a lot of problems also in how
25:36 these supermarkets order food
25:39 right so there was already something in
25:41 his mind then uh at the same time like
25:44 when I broke up with the uh my team so
25:47 the the pharma um guy he also broke up
25:51 with his uh teammate at the time which
25:54 was also in healthcare by the way um and
25:56 uh we found each other at basically the
26:00 last week before the closing of the of
26:02 the program of the forum phase and we
26:05 really wanted to have a startup like
26:07 absolutely 100% there was no question uh
26:10 in my mind that I was not going to go
26:12 out with a startup out of that and uh we
26:15 were friends from the beginning with
26:17 Aric uh so we were always having beers
26:20 uh and the
26:22 uh the thing that we were also trying to
26:25 ideate with other people obviously
26:26 because you want to stick to what the EF
26:28 people say, you know, try to find a
26:30 business uh like a business person that
26:32 started from business. Uh right. So, we
26:35 were talking with a couple of people,
26:36 but we found that, you know, we were
26:38 actually ideulating much faster between
26:40 each other. And so, we started ideating
26:43 about like uh product recognition uh if
26:47 we could use perhaps what is done in his
26:49 thesis. Uh and we started thinking about
26:52 uh oh, can we do something uh for
26:54 pricing for example, right? So we can
26:57 recognize uh what these products if
27:00 these products are going bad like I was
27:01 thinking also in a um let's say social
27:05 good sense uh a little bit because it's
27:07 kind of dear to my heart to do something
27:09 for the for climate change uh that was a
27:11 big topic also between my projects and
27:13 ENF
27:15 and uh in the end we we we started to
27:19 see that uh there are a lot of problems
27:21 with uh shelf life um with estimating
27:24 shelf lives and and and keeping track of
27:27 what is going bad etc etc. So we started
27:30 ideating in that sense. Can we do
27:32 something with computer vision that
27:34 looks at fresh products and um you know
27:37 tells you know the people that are
27:40 buying the fresh products um are these
27:43 going bad and we started ideating on
27:46 that and we thought oh maybe we can do
27:47 an app uh that can do that and uh on we
27:52 we went actually to so-called super
27:54 check-in which is like a mini IC a mini
27:56 investment committee.
27:58 Mhm. uh with that idea, which is
28:00 basically a um an app that um you can
28:04 use as a consumer and you can go in the
28:07 store with uh and then you would take a
28:09 photo of like um a fresh product or like
28:12 a a packaged product, you will take a
28:14 photo of the barcode or something and
28:16 the and the um expir expiration date.
28:20 And instead of fresh products, we will
28:22 do the analysis of the ripeness in in
28:24 the app using computer vision. uh and
28:27 then it will give you a discount that
28:28 then you can apply at checkout.
28:31 Didn't fly very well with the investment
28:33 committee to be honest. So we went back
28:36 to the drawing board and we honestly we
28:38 learned from that. We learned that um it
28:41 was first of all it was really hard for
28:43 people to get another app just to get
28:46 some discounts even though there are
28:47 discounts sometimes is not enough. Um
28:51 and then we learned that um yeah it's
28:54 not that easy actually to figure out the
28:56 shelf life of fresh bars just using
28:58 computer vision. Um so we we pivoted uh
29:03 and uh we started like thinking and
29:06 while thinking he realized oh wait I
29:08 remember this conversation that I had
29:10 with these uh these people and I
29:12 remember that actually uh waste and
29:15 stockouts are a huge problem and we kind
29:19 of wanted to avoid all of that because
29:20 both let's say our edges are definitely
29:23 in computer vision like we we did a lot
29:25 of computer vision um but we um we we
29:29 saw that uh this could actually be a
29:32 much bigger problem. Um and when we
29:35 started looking at the numbers and then
29:36 we started looking about the numbers
29:38 about food waste and it's completely
29:40 mindboggling. Um just to give you uh
29:43 like an idea. So food waste uh is
29:47 actually accounting for six times more
29:49 carbon emissions per year than the
29:52 entire aviation industry.
29:53 W
29:55 uh that's a lot, right?
29:56 It's insane. Like when I read that I was
29:59 like I cannot believe this. This is
30:00 crazy.
30:01 Yeah. This is uh very crazy.
30:03 Yeah. And uh we wasting like 1.7
30:06 trillion dollars per year in food like
30:09 food that gets never sold basically. But
30:12 someone has to buy it, right? The
30:14 supermarkets have to buy it.
30:16 Uh and supermarkets out of all food
30:18 waste contribute to 10% of that. So if
30:21 we can contribute to 10%
30:24 of uh six times the aviation industry,
30:27 we're almost like fixing the aviation
30:30 industry right there. So that would be
30:32 fantastic. Um and um so we we got really
30:37 really excited and then we saw that also
30:38 there are some uh exceptional companies
30:41 in the US that are doing something
30:43 similar to us. Um some of them are Shelf
30:46 Engine and AFresh and uh they are uh
30:49 they're doing really well. uh and um we
30:52 really really appreciate what they're
30:53 doing and we just wanted to follow suit
30:56 and uh started our own company as
30:57 freshly here.
30:59 Nice. Uh
31:02 and I'm also wondering um how important
31:05 is to go through a startup accelerator
31:07 in this case would you be able to do
31:09 this without entrepreneur first or no
31:11 way?
31:11 No.
31:13 As simple as that. uh to I think to have
31:17 the kind of connections that
31:18 entrepreneur first gives you um you need
31:22 to be extremely lucky um maybe go to a
31:26 very specific place um in life uh like
31:29 for example I think in AIC's case uh ETH
31:33 helped a lot because they have a
31:34 entrepreneur uh kind of club and so if
31:38 you're already interested in that you
31:39 join the club and you see like a lot of
31:41 people that have ideas professors that
31:43 can help etc. etc. people that actually
31:45 create their startups uh during
31:47 university time. If you're in the Ivy
31:50 League, of course, there are a lot of
31:51 people that also uh in these university
31:53 they they startups. But uh you know from
31:57 free university of Amsterdam, there was
31:58 no such thing. Uh and from uh University
32:01 of Amsterdam, sorry, University of
32:03 Bologna uh I didn't find uh anything
32:06 like that. Um and I didn't look around
32:08 at my brief time at University of
32:10 Amsterdam. So like I didn't have these
32:12 kind of possibilities. So that really
32:15 changes the game completely. Like uh I
32:18 have a lot of friends now from
32:19 Entrepreneur First just because we vibe
32:20 so much together. It's like we're also
32:23 ambitious and creative and kind of
32:25 risk-taking. So
32:27 yeah, definitely you need you need the
32:29 kind of right.
32:29 It's about uh building connections. It's
32:32 about networking, right? So if you have
32:34 already a strong network from your
32:36 university or maybe I know and I I know
32:39 that in Berlin for example there are
32:42 startup uh meetups for example or
32:45 founder dating meetups. So if you're in
32:47 this area maybe it's possible right to
32:49 build this network but uh entrepreneur
32:52 first helps you to do that. Yeah, and I
32:54 would say it's still hard uh even though
32:56 you would have the network then you need
32:58 to find a co-founder that is really
33:01 driving with you and uh you need to have
33:03 the time to also think about uh the the
33:06 idea and really develop it and kind of
33:08 try to do it as quickly as possible. Uh
33:10 that's always the conundrum of being in
33:12 a startup. You want to always be one
33:14 step ahead than you are and so that
33:16 requires a lot of time. So
33:19 um yeah I would say without entrepreneur
33:21 first would have been really really
33:22 hard.
33:23 So how did you find your first client?
33:26 So G like running a pilot with Etica I
33:29 think it's awesome. So is it your first
33:31 client?
33:32 Yeah. Uh well technically we had also
33:34 another client uh which came from uh uh
33:38 AIC's previous dwellings in uh in the
33:40 supermarket space. So this other client
33:42 is actually Vog which is the third
33:44 largest supermarket chain in uh in
33:46 Switzerland. Um but in V we tried like
33:51 um a slightly different product. So uh
33:53 for Vogue though uh we did like a pilot
33:56 and it all went well. uh but for the
34:00 let's say uh the the first client in
34:02 Germany um which is EDA we actually
34:05 entered through the EDA futa campus
34:07 which is a startup accelerator by EDA um
34:11 where they also give you mentorship and
34:14 they try to connect you to the right uh
34:16 EDIA stores that are perhaps more
34:18 open-minded to new things uh and um yeah
34:22 after explaining our idea they we got in
34:25 uh really nice people at the foot
34:27 compost they connected to the right uh
34:29 to the right people in uh in Edica and
34:31 uh we refined our idea and we refined
34:34 our product and then we started working
34:36 with um with Edica Pesios.
34:39 Was it before you graduated entrepreneur
34:42 first or after?
34:43 After after
34:44 after. Okay. Yeah.
34:45 So you don't need to get a client to
34:48 graduate, right?
34:50 Well, it would be beneficial.
34:53 Um but they bet on us. First of all, we
34:55 we formed at the last week of form. So,
34:58 we had only like three weeks uh four
35:01 four weeks to really like uh get all of
35:05 the narrative together, get the SL the
35:07 pitch deck, uh get the all of all of the
35:10 things together. Um all of the
35:13 possibilities for the future, the
35:14 business model, blah blah blah. So,
35:16 quite a lot of work in a short amount of
35:18 time. uh and then
35:21 after that yeah you start with uh with
35:23 really building but and also we started
35:25 building the the algorithms and stuff at
35:28 the same time. So it was quite busy
35:29 anyway. Uh but yeah other startups uh
35:32 they also may need to show that they
35:35 have some traction early on. We already
35:36 had some traction at the time actually
35:38 uh now that I remember uh we had quite a
35:40 few leads uh with uh other supermarket
35:43 chains in Italy and in Germany uh which
35:47 in the end it didn't uh didn't go
35:49 through but uh yeah we had actually like
35:51 around four or five leads. So yeah there
35:54 needs to be some traction for sure.
35:56 So how much time uh like be like between
36:00 the time you came up an idea and the
36:02 time you secured the first client. How
36:05 much time uh was that?
36:07 Yeah. Uh unfortunately the supermarket
36:09 space is not that fast. So the sales
36:11 cycle is quite long. Um so we got um we
36:16 got ultimately uh our contract signed
36:18 and all with uh with our first ADA store
36:21 in April. Um and we graduated from EF in
36:26 um in uh January.
36:29 Mhm.
36:30 Yeah. But we're officially like
36:31 registered as a company and all from
36:33 April as well. just okay
36:34 also takes time to do that
36:36 there a lot of paperwork here in Germany
36:38 Germany right
36:39 and yeah I also prepared a question
36:41 about investors um I guess you answered
36:44 that so entrepreneur first acts as an
36:46 investor there are there is a board and
36:49 then they decide whether they should
36:50 invest or not is it the only investor
36:53 you have
36:54 uh
36:57 is
37:00 you don't have
37:01 so there there are things that we will
37:02 announce later. But uh at the moment
37:05 officially there is only them. Yeah.
37:07 Uh there is we're lining up actually
37:10 angel investors at the moment and we
37:12 have uh an amazing guy as an angel
37:15 investor which we would love to announce
37:17 but it's in the works.
37:19 Mhm. Well, you don't have to announce
37:21 but maybe you can tell us about the
37:23 process like how do you actually do? So
37:26 with entrepreneur first okay they have
37:28 this committee that decide if they
37:30 invest or not but once you graduated
37:33 once you don't have the support from EF
37:35 how do you go about finding an investor
37:38 right uh actually EF uh gives you a
37:40 fundraising manager after you graduate
37:43 um and um they help you a lot with like
37:46 how to structure the narrative uh how to
37:49 find the investors and stuff they also
37:51 give you a platform called demo day uh
37:53 which is basically like a Well, in
37:55 corona times it's just like a web page
37:57 with some YouTube videos, but it used to
38:00 be that you go to a theater and there
38:01 are 100 investors invited and then they
38:04 will basically like talk to you after
38:06 the um the the talk that you give the
38:09 pitch. Um we decided to not go for demo
38:12 day. Uh interestingly because we found
38:15 that um in our specific case um you know
38:19 we need to be proven with the numbers
38:22 and the uh measures that we get from the
38:25 pilots themselves in order to gain
38:27 traction since it's such a slow industry
38:30 and it's such a core competency of the
38:35 supermarkets. So very hard actually to
38:37 sell um because imagine you're you're
38:41 substituting a really like core part of
38:44 the entire ordering system or of the
38:46 entire of what the supermarket does. If
38:47 you think about a supermarket is you get
38:50 stuff in and you get stuff out and you
38:53 have to present them well. Okay. So we
38:55 fix the get stuff in and then they have
38:58 to think about present them well and get
39:00 stuff out, right? So pretty hard to
39:02 sell.
39:03 Okay. Yeah. So,
39:06 and we want to raise on our terms later.
39:07 That's also why
39:09 by having more traction. Yeah.
39:12 So, if you didn't go through this demo
39:14 day, like are there like what kind of
39:17 places where people can look for
39:19 investors? Like are there meetups or
39:22 Right. Um well, investors approach you
39:24 actually. Okay.
39:26 Uh how do you do they find you? like do
39:29 you just post on LinkedIn hey I'm
39:31 looking for investors or
39:33 I think uh just by the fact that you
39:35 have co-founder in the name uh they they
39:38 they search for you um okay
39:40 in LinkedIn and also I believe they may
39:43 have some bots from the handles register
39:46 um so the the register of companies in
39:49 Germany they may actually get scraped by
39:53 them and they know of all the companies
39:56 so they probably have a bunch of
39:57 analysts in the VC uh firm and they go
40:01 through all these companies. They look
40:02 it up. They see what they're doing. If
40:04 they they think it's good enough, they
40:05 will definitely shoot an email. So, not
40:08 that hard to find any investor. To find
40:11 the good investors, it's up to you. So,
40:13 you um there are certain investors that
40:17 um you know, you want to have uh in your
40:20 board because they have specific
40:21 expertise, right? So, for example,
40:23 investors that usually are in the food
40:26 tech industry are great for us. Um, and
40:30 um, other investors that are like
40:33 high-profile, they usually like less um,
40:37 hands-on, more like um, you know, they
40:40 they care rather than they try to
40:42 control. So, um, these kind of
40:45 investors, yeah, you need to do a little
40:46 bit of the work yourself perhaps
40:48 sometimes and try to try to approach
40:50 them and stuff.
40:52 Yeah. I'm curious. So you said like
40:53 there are investors and there are good
40:55 investors. So what could be the
40:58 consequences of going with bad investor?
41:02 Well um you may get like a bad turn
41:05 sheet uh where basically um they take a
41:10 lot of your equity uh for not so much
41:12 money. uh you um you may get uh I don't
41:18 know some other little caveats in the
41:20 term sheet uh that you may not like. Uh
41:23 you may get like uh people in the board
41:26 that perhaps are uh trying to control
41:28 too much
41:29 uh of your company. Um, and there's not
41:32 so much a culture of trust, but it's
41:34 rather a culture of like, uh, hey, we
41:37 give you the money, like we want the
41:38 money back immediately, kind of like try
41:40 to grow as fast as possible, blah, blah,
41:42 which is going to be, you know, it is
41:44 pretty common with investors that they
41:46 want to do that. I mean, it's their job
41:47 ultimately, but there's some of them
41:48 they do it in a more kind of um
41:52 empathetic, nurturing
41:54 um way that is more enjoyable for
41:56 everybody. uh and some of them they
41:58 might do it in a more predatorial way
42:00 but I've we we at the moment we don't
42:03 have uh anybody in the board because EF
42:06 gave us a convertible note so uh it's
42:08 very it's very chill and very quiet
42:10 maybe a actually if he was my co-founder
42:14 uh would have more insights into this
42:16 question actually
42:18 okay yeah understand
42:21 and uh I'm curious what uh so you have
42:25 pretty similar profiles even though it's
42:26 more entrepreneurial uh but at the end
42:29 you're both kind of engineers right you
42:31 both coders
42:33 so how do you split so first of all what
42:35 do you do
42:36 what does he do and how do you split
42:38 these possibilities
42:40 yeah um good question so of course at
42:43 first we wanted to do everything
42:44 together uh but then we decided that
42:47 actually that was not going to like
42:49 really help uh that much because then
42:50 you have to synchronize ideas on every
42:52 single little thing so and I don't think
42:55 the productivity gains are very much
42:57 higher. But it's good at first I think
42:59 to think about the major the major
43:01 things together and to continue to do
43:03 that all the time and we continue to do
43:05 that every day. Um
43:08 but uh of course right now I'm fully the
43:10 CTO so I do uh all of the tech uh almost
43:14 all of the tech. I didn't do the mobile
43:15 app. Um
43:18 and um he uh is doing all of the sales
43:21 and business development.
43:23 Mhm. So all the outreach to possible
43:25 clients uh talking to them talking to
43:28 investors making the pitch deck uh and I
43:30 do all of the uh pipelines and the uh
43:34 code and uh uh data mangling and the
43:38 dashboards and connections to the app
43:41 and the machine learning algorithms and
43:42 the experiments.
43:43 All the engineering stuff, right?
43:45 All the engineering stuff. Yeah. Yeah.
43:47 Do you have other people in the company
43:49 now?
43:50 Yeah, we we do. So uh we have a mobile
43:53 developer
43:55 who created the the app right
43:56 the one who created the app uh amazing
43:59 guy uh fantastic
44:01 um unfortunately the the contract for
44:03 the freelancer ended but uh we hope that
44:05 maybe in the future we can uh we can
44:07 come back and work together. Um and um
44:11 yeah he he is um yeah he did an amazing
44:14 job. Uh we uh uh also have a working
44:19 student uh which is from University of
44:21 Manim. Um he's uh also in uh in the
44:24 business side
44:26 and he helps AVIC with that.
44:28 Yeah. But we're going to start hiring
44:30 actually more people soon.
44:31 Mhm.
44:32 Um so since uh maybe this topic is
44:36 already on your mind about hiring,
44:38 how how do you decide who to to hire
44:41 first? So you needed an app. So you
44:43 hired a freelancer who did the app and
44:45 then uh you know he went on for working
44:48 for another gig.
44:49 But for a permanent employee, how do you
44:51 decide who to hire first?
44:54 That's a good question. So um I would
44:57 say it's the same thing. Uh for the app
44:59 or like the the permanent person um the
45:05 it's very simple. Uh it feels like like
45:08 when you are in the in the job you kind
45:10 of know what you need, right? Uh but I
45:13 think the a good principle to think
45:15 about is like don't necessarily try to
45:18 do everything yourself if you're not an
45:20 expert in it. So like feel compelled to
45:24 uh actually ask for help and ask for
45:26 help in this case means hiring someone.
45:28 So, uh, at first I thought, oh, maybe I
45:31 can also like pick up Flutter and do the
45:33 app and blah blah blah. But then
45:35 honestly, like by thinking about it, it
45:36 would have pushed us, you know, several
45:39 months uh back just because I would need
45:43 to like learn a new language uh then
45:46 code the app in that language, blah blah
45:48 blah. Uh, I would probably do a worse
45:50 job than what Jeremiah did. So, like
45:53 Jeremiah is the amazing mobile
45:55 developer. Um and yeah in the end it
45:59 doesn't doesn't really make sense. Uh we
46:01 had the investment uh already so why not
46:04 use it and uh spare my time to do
46:06 something that I can do much better. So
46:09 basically as a founder as a co-ounder
46:13 one of the things you need to uh do is
46:16 uh know how to delegate right and know
46:18 how to let things go like not try to do
46:21 things yourself. I am pretty sure you
46:22 would do enough but it would just take
46:24 more time right. Exactly. Yeah. So, um
46:28 asking for help uh is a great thing. Uh
46:31 it's a
46:33 I know that uh if especially if you're
46:35 entrepreneurally minded, you want to be
46:37 the one doing all of it, but it's not
46:40 shameful at all. Uh and it actually it
46:44 is quite pretty appreciated by the
46:45 clients because they see the product
46:46 faster, by the investors because they
46:48 see their money back faster by basically
46:50 everybody. Mhm. And uh I don't know if
46:54 this is a problem you had you have had
46:56 or not but I imagine that u you as a
47:00 startup um when you need to hire people
47:03 maybe the package you can offer to
47:06 candidates is less attractive than you
47:08 know big well established companies such
47:10 as Zanda or Amazon or I don't know leaks
47:13 for example. So uh how do you manage to
47:18 make this uh offer package attractive?
47:21 Have you thought about this already?
47:22 Like how do you attract people to work
47:24 at startup?
47:25 Uh we hired internationally so we we
47:27 were not afraid to go into different
47:29 countries. Um and um fortunately in in
47:33 the end uh our mobile dev uh basically
47:37 joined because he just loves the
47:38 technology and he wanted to do something
47:41 in uh in that technology. he because he
47:43 used to do it in his free time. Uh and
47:46 uh he um he felt like you know he can at
47:50 least have some money out of it. Um and
47:54 so I think this is a very special case
47:55 of a extremely passionate person who
47:58 really wanted to bring something to the
47:59 world and maybe you know have also some
48:01 fun and some money um in that in flatter
48:04 specifically. But um I would say for in
48:09 in general like uh our offer was
48:11 attractive because for example we will
48:13 pay the same rate in all parts of the
48:15 world.
48:16 Mhm.
48:16 So um so for example for an Indian
48:19 developer that would be like an amazing
48:20 salary.
48:21 Mhm. Okay. So maybe for somebody from
48:24 Berlin it will be like an okayish one
48:26 but if they go to a bigger company maybe
48:29 they would offer more but for somebody
48:31 from uh like where the average salary is
48:34 not as uh like lower than in Germany
48:37 then for them it's
48:38 yeah I think co opened this amazing
48:41 possibility of remote working uh to
48:43 everybody just we just open our eyes and
48:45 we were like oh right we can do this. So
48:47 uh we just kind of took advantage of of
48:49 that fact. Mhm. Okay. Yeah. Nice. So,
48:53 what are your plans for the future?
48:55 Great question. Uh more clients, more
48:57 product, uh more shipping, more
48:59 launches,
49:01 uh more money, more investors, more
49:04 hires, uh bigger clients,
49:08 and grow from there. Yeah. And this is
49:11 kind of this is of course uh of course
49:14 the plan, but I'd say um we want to in
49:20 the longer term future uh be kind of the
49:23 um the grocery food retailer OS
49:28 uh where it's a one-stop shop for all of
49:31 their uh logistics and supply chain
49:33 needs. And we want to also go um in uh
49:38 the other steps in the chain. So go up
49:41 to the distribution centers, the
49:43 fulfillment centers, the uh perhaps
49:46 sometimes even go beyond that and go as
49:50 much as possible towards even the
49:51 farmers and the um the the people with
49:55 the um the grow the cows and uh the pigs
49:59 and stuff. Um because there is so much
50:02 that can be done at all these levels to
50:06 uh predict what uh kind of food needs to
50:10 be on the on the shelves ultimately of
50:12 the supermarkets and uh we feel like we
50:15 can have so much impact by having one
50:19 solution that would actually kind of
50:21 enable what is the uh just in time
50:23 supply chain of Toyota. Right? So like
50:25 when for example uh there is um you know
50:29 I need a banana right now cuz I'm
50:32 hungry. Uh then my system will know oh
50:35 carina it's okay it's Friday it's 6 p.m.
50:38 uh you know you just had a long day once
50:40 a banana. So then uh preemptively would
50:44 actually predict all of that months in
50:46 advance and the farmer will be like okay
50:49 I need to produce this many bananas.
50:51 I think Amazon is doing that already. I
50:54 think I I sometimes feel like Amazon can
50:56 read my mind because I ran out of
50:58 shampoo recently. I went to to buy and
51:00 then on the first page it was already
51:02 recommending me shampoo.
51:04 Ah interesting. But see the that's
51:06 another side which is the recommendation
51:08 side.
51:09 Um which is uh yeah quite similar
51:12 actually to forecasting. So there's a
51:13 lot of things that I learned in Alex
51:16 come back uh here in this work. Um but
51:20 yeah it will be much more towards
51:21 forecasting. Mhm.
51:23 specifically. Um and with the just in
51:26 time supply chain, uh what you have is a
51:28 lot less inventory space.
51:31 Uh so that means also like less needs
51:33 for huge warehouses, less need for um
51:36 transportation.
51:38 So also trucking and all that uh
51:40 actually spends a lot of you know they
51:42 burn a lot of uh fossil fuels. Uh not
51:44 great for the environment. So it's not
51:48 just the problem of like you know the
51:50 rotten food that has CO2 that gets
51:52 released to the planet.
51:53 There's a lot going on actually in the
51:55 supply chain that can be fixed by having
51:58 uh by ordering the exact amount. The
52:01 exact amount is really really hard
52:03 because if you order too much you're
52:05 producing just waste
52:07 and the retailers try to do that because
52:10 they don't like uh to have their shelves
52:12 empty.
52:13 That's really bad. that means that
52:14 they're losing customers. Uh you know,
52:17 the customers will go to another store
52:19 if their shelves are empty. And with
52:21 fresh products specifically, you have
52:24 all of them in boxes, right? So if you
52:26 have, let's say, the last bananas or the
52:28 last two bananas, it's basically like
52:30 the shelf is empty because the last two
52:32 bananas, nobody picks them up.
52:36 Yeah, I know. I wouldn't.
52:39 Exactly. You think something's wrong
52:41 with them.
52:42 Exactly.
52:43 Exactly. So um given consumer behavior
52:47 and um these other factors, they need to
52:49 keep stocking the shelves.
52:52 Um but then it's really really hard to
52:54 stock him exactly that they look kind of
52:56 full even at the end of the day. But yet
52:58 in the back room there's nothing
53:01 and what we found is that that's not the
53:03 case obviously because it's really
53:04 really tough. So we try to to fix that
53:06 problem.
53:08 Okay. Interesting. Would you do anything
53:10 differently now like if you were
53:12 starting a game?
53:13 Yes. Um I would not use open source
53:17 infrastructure. I would directly use
53:19 GCP. That was
53:23 uh we switched from um from an open-
53:26 source uh MLOps infrastructure that you
53:29 may know what it is. It's called Qflow.
53:33 It was uh giving us it was fantastic
53:35 when it worked uh to be honest. Then we
53:38 uh we uh upgraded to I think 1.3 and it
53:42 started breaking in different ways and
53:44 1.2 also gave us a lot of troubles um
53:47 with um with the installation and stuff
53:50 and I I spent I think like just one
53:53 month or one and a half months just just
53:58 taking care of CubeFlow
54:02 which I think for a startup is not a
54:04 great idea. Uh so at the end I just said
54:07 okay fine we're in GCP we used the GCP
54:10 stuff and uh so glad that we went for
54:12 GCP also uh much better interfaces and
54:16 uh and software that we're used to in in
54:19 AWS. Uh we're using BigQuery uh cloud
54:23 run cloud functions event arc. It's an
54:26 event-driven architecture so everything
54:28 that comes in gets pushed around in
54:30 these pipelines. Uh we use fire store
54:33 for the uh for the app API which is
54:37 lightning fast. Uh it it's beautiful uh
54:39 and it just works.
54:42 Yeah. I guess one advice that you would
54:44 uh one piece you would give to um
54:48 somebody who is starting a startup. So
54:49 go with a managed solution right for
54:51 Yeah. Go with a managed solution instead
54:53 of a instead of a open source solution
54:56 at least at first.
54:58 Okay. And um the good thing is that for
55:00 a startup uh the uh the folks at Google
55:04 and the folks at AWS if you are in
55:07 anredit if if you're invested by an
55:09 accredited investor of them um they will
55:12 actually give you some credits. Uh so we
55:14 received 100k uh in credits uh from
55:18 Google. Uh so that that means that we
55:20 can we can you know use their most
55:23 expensive solutions uh and and yet not
55:26 like sleep well at night. Okay. Yeah.
55:28 So, basically they bet on you that uh
55:30 you know you will grow. That's why they
55:32 invest uh 100k in their services. That's
55:36 that's very nice of them.
55:37 Yeah. Yeah. And at the end if you really
55:39 like their services you will you will
55:42 continue.
55:42 Yeah. Exactly.
55:44 Yeah. So this this is I think one of the
55:47 things that in the tech space Yeah. we
55:50 could have done differently.
55:51 Do you have any other advice for people
55:53 who would like to start building a
55:55 startup now?
55:58 Wow. Um, where do we start? Um,
56:03 I would say that uh it's it's going to
56:06 be okay. Everybody says the same uh that
56:09 it's going to be hard and you're going
56:10 to have tough times. Uh, and it is true.
56:14 And just be prepared and uh be just um
56:18 very um yeah emotionally uh intelligent
56:23 that uh um you know sometimes let's say
56:26 a sales calls doesn't go well. Uh it may
56:29 not be you. Okay. So it's not don't it's
56:32 not personal it's not a personal thing.
56:33 It is rather like perhaps that uh you
56:36 could
56:38 um I don't know not talk about the
56:40 specifics of your solution. There's no
56:42 need. Sometimes you can say it's just
56:43 IP. Uh there is perhaps like another
56:47 concern that you cannot address at the
56:49 moment because you're just too small and
56:51 you don't know certain things, right? So
56:53 uh the the struggle at first is
56:56 basically a mismatch between the fact
56:58 that you want to have the best clients
57:00 in order to have the best contracts, in
57:02 order to have the best uh investors, in
57:05 order to be able to hire the best
57:07 people, etc., etc., but you're not there
57:09 yet. And so you're always like trying to
57:13 get to that point and it is really
57:15 really hard to cope with all that load
57:18 that you put on yourself. Uh so be
57:20 mindful of that and um I would say uh
57:24 find a co-founder that is on the same
57:27 page as you uh that you can communicate
57:30 really well with.
57:32 uh and not necessarily
57:34 um you know it doesn't have to be the
57:36 best salesperson in the world if he's on
57:38 the business side or it doesn't have to
57:40 be the best um technical person in the
57:42 world although it kind of helps but uh
57:45 it only helps up to a certain
57:46 percentage. Um so there was actually
57:50 like a presentation that my girlfriend
57:51 did. She's a recruiter uh that says that
57:54 uh you should hire at least in
57:56 behavioral interview you should hire for
57:58 um 10% skills
58:01 at least 10. Okay. Okay. So the
58:03 framework is uh how much uh skills and
58:07 um
58:09 competency so like behaviors and how
58:13 much um motivation actually plays out in
58:18 uh the uh final performance of
58:20 employees. So skills is about 10 to 20%.
58:23 And then the rest is motivation and
58:25 behavior. So like try to get people try
58:28 to hire people for motivation and
58:29 behavior.
58:31 Uh, and if you get motivation, behavior,
58:33 skills, you're just golden.
58:35 Uh, but with your co-founder, you're
58:36 going to speak every day. And if he's
58:38 motivated enough, he's going to figure
58:40 it out.
58:41 He's uh if he's behavior is great also,
58:44 he's going to figure it out. So that's
58:46 another advice. Try to get these kind of
58:47 people. Don't fix too much on skills.
58:50 Yeah. Thanks. Do you have like five 10
58:52 more minutes? I realized we have a lot
58:54 of questions and uh
58:56 Sure. Happy to uh some of them. So the
58:59 first question is about books that you
59:01 mentioned. I think it was design
59:02 thinking and the M tests, right?
59:04 That's right.
59:06 I'll just put them in the description
59:08 after we finish that talk.
59:10 Um then the second question from Ali is
59:13 about how do you get uh continuous
59:16 motivation to to do this stuff? Uh
59:20 coming from you know a software
59:22 engineering kind of background. Uh how
59:24 do you do this? I guess in a startup
59:26 when things don't work as well you said
59:30 you need to think about like maybe it's
59:31 not you right it's them but like how do
59:34 you get this continuous motivation
59:35 probably you manage to keep doing this
59:39 it's kind of in you uh so I don't know
59:42 if there is a way to get motivation uh
59:46 like for me for example I really care
59:49 about uh like climate change and the
59:52 food waste problem uh it seems to be the
59:56 kind of the underdog of the climate
59:58 change spectrum of problems, right? It's
1:00:00 it's actually right there is in front of
1:00:02 us. Uh and it is massive like again like
1:00:06 that six times the number of uh uh CO2
1:00:10 emissions than the aviation industry is
1:00:12 a massive number. If you think about it
1:00:14 differently, it is if you think about
1:00:18 food waste as a country in terms of
1:00:20 carbon emission, it will be the third
1:00:22 country in the world. Uh so after US and
1:00:26 China, there will be food waste and then
1:00:28 there will be India with half of the
1:00:31 carbon emission of food waste which is
1:00:34 that's just insane. It seems like we
1:00:36 have to do this. Uh and it seems like
1:00:39 also the opportunity space is is pretty
1:00:42 big like the food retail industry is um
1:00:46 is now just now like in this process of
1:00:49 digitalization and the opportunity for
1:00:53 you know companies like ours is just is
1:00:55 just great. Um and then yeah you work
1:00:58 with the right people and I guess that
1:01:02 that's what you need. But I guess
1:01:03 motivation comes from the inside of what
1:01:05 you care about. Mhm. Okay. Thank you. So
1:01:08 there is a question from Isak is uh I'm
1:01:11 30 years old. I want to be a CTO in a
1:01:14 startup uh launching my own with a CEO I
1:01:17 guess very similar to what he did. So
1:01:20 his main focus is machine learning and
1:01:22 he knows little about front end
1:01:24 development devops and all these things.
1:01:28 So the question is do you think it's
1:01:31 enough to start as ZTO or or not? Um it
1:01:35 it could be it could be getting tough
1:01:37 sometimes I guess. Um uh but honestly if
1:01:40 you use like a managed solution and you
1:01:43 can spend some time like figuring out
1:01:45 like new concepts um I don't think it's
1:01:49 a problem that you have only like the
1:01:50 machine learning background. Again like
1:01:52 what I said before the framework that
1:01:55 they used in my my girlfriend's company
1:01:57 uh 10% to 20% skill uh 50% motivation
1:02:02 and then the rest is uh behavior. Mhm.
1:02:04 Do you think um he should learn
1:02:06 something now before becoming a founder
1:02:08 or
1:02:09 Yeah, sure. Yeah, much better now
1:02:11 because then you have pressures from
1:02:13 investors, from clients, from your
1:02:14 co-founder, from your hires. So like
1:02:17 please start as soon as possible
1:02:19 but then you will never start like you
1:02:21 will always think okay I'm not ready
1:02:23 yet. I need to learn this thing like
1:02:25 there is this new framework that you
1:02:26 need to learn and there is this new book
1:02:28 that everyone says it's good then like
1:02:31 how do you know that you're ready? uh
1:02:33 you don't but uh you will will never
1:02:37 feel ready to be honest like even uh
1:02:40 honestly I have more than 10 years of
1:02:41 experience in software engineering and
1:02:43 yet like I don't I didn't think I was
1:02:46 ready for a startup until I joined the F
1:02:48 and I was like wait a second I'm
1:02:49 actually not that bad I can actually do
1:02:52 this so um like you can also just jump
1:02:56 in and figure it out on the spot
1:02:58 absolutely um I would say maybe uh if
1:03:02 you for example go for entrepreneur
1:03:04 first. Um if you get in uh like start as
1:03:07 early as possible.
1:03:09 Um and start as early as possible doing
1:03:12 um maybe not necessarily technical stuff
1:03:15 but um even just like figuring out the
1:03:18 problem space and stuff like that. Like
1:03:21 start doing something if you if you can.
1:03:24 But um don't be afraid of also just
1:03:26 jumping in. actually think that just
1:03:29 jumping in will propel you to know these
1:03:31 things by itself. It's a bit of a
1:03:33 balance. I know it's I know this answer
1:03:35 sucks because I it's what is it exactly
1:03:39 that you're trying to recommend but uh
1:03:41 either works if you have enough
1:03:42 motivation I would say
1:03:44 and uh what do you think about
1:03:46 importance of a business school?
1:03:49 Um not important whatsoever.
1:03:52 Okay. Okay. So you be fine without going
1:03:56 to a business school without an MBA
1:03:58 right?
1:03:59 Yeah. Uh so the the thing about MBAs
1:04:02 from what I learned from other friends
1:04:04 that did MBAs even at big MBA firms like
1:04:07 inad etc. like you don't need one for a
1:04:10 startup. Um and what they teach you
1:04:14 there are concepts for running like
1:04:16 largecale businesses. You know, in a
1:04:19 startup, you have such a specific set of
1:04:22 challenges that are specific to your
1:04:23 markets and and all and um don't need to
1:04:27 have like, you know, these grand scheme
1:04:30 of things uh kind of overviews or, you
1:04:32 know, how to do like a specific business
1:04:36 uh case or a specific thing in a very
1:04:38 structured way is much more like um ship
1:04:42 it as soon as possible. That's what you
1:04:45 want to do.
1:04:46 Okay. Yeah. So it's more about the
1:04:47 mindset, right?
1:04:48 Yeah,
1:04:50 absolutely.
1:04:50 I think there is a book called ship it.
1:04:52 I think it's about that.
1:04:53 There must be at least one. Yeah.
1:04:55 I think it's this is how it's called
1:04:57 ship it.
1:04:58 Yeah, I think I heard about it. Yeah.
1:05:00 Yeah, I haven't read that, but I imagine
1:05:02 it's good.
1:05:03 Yeah.
1:05:04 Okay. Uh oh, we have another question.
1:05:06 So, what happens if you don't find a
1:05:08 co-founder at EF?
1:05:10 Well, you're out also. Yeah.
1:05:13 Yeah. Um
1:05:15 so you have to have a co-founder.
1:05:17 You have to have a co-founder when you
1:05:18 are in the in the form phase. So they
1:05:20 give you these eight weeks just uh use
1:05:23 them correctly. Try to uh if you go for
1:05:25 EF um like try to get into a team as
1:05:29 soon as possible. Don't like waste your
1:05:31 time thinking is this the right person?
1:05:33 is this not is am I blah blah blah like
1:05:37 um figure it out like let's say get some
1:05:41 answers of course don't get to with the
1:05:43 first person that you meet but um if you
1:05:46 vibe enough just go for it
1:05:49 that's kind of the startup mentality
1:05:51 just just go for it
1:05:52 and another another question that uh we
1:05:56 just got is uh would you recommend to
1:05:58 start uh with EF if you already have a
1:06:02 pretty clear idea I think you just said
1:06:04 just go for it. Would you answer that as
1:06:06 well?
1:06:07 Ah um I would actually start with EF
1:06:11 even though you have a pre-existing
1:06:12 idea. Uh I also had a pre-existing idea
1:06:15 which is I I actually tried it in the
1:06:17 first uh few weeks of EF uh with another
1:06:20 team right uh and
1:06:23 we also figured out that the market may
1:06:26 have not been exactly ready or the best
1:06:29 kind of market for for that kind of
1:06:32 idea. Okay.
1:06:33 Um, so being in EF will also like teach
1:06:36 you uh how things work in the real world
1:06:40 because sometimes before you you're
1:06:42 stuck in your own uh bubble, right? So
1:06:45 for example, when we're working at Olex,
1:06:47 you know, we may know a lot about
1:06:48 marketplaces and about data science, but
1:06:51 not about like uh you know the all the
1:06:53 business side uh in in of things in
1:06:56 general, how uh investors think about
1:06:58 who to invest in etc etc. So
1:07:01 it will give you that kind of mentality.
1:07:03 Mhm.
1:07:04 Okay. We have another question and that
1:07:06 will be the last one. So uh did you
1:07:09 already have a prototype before your
1:07:11 pitch?
1:07:12 Um no we had uh like a demo of um so for
1:07:18 the for the first pitch so for the super
1:07:20 checkin we had a demo of the computer
1:07:23 vision uh recognition of uh ripeness uh
1:07:28 on bananas only and it was web- based
1:07:31 so it works with TensorFlowJS. Uh but
1:07:34 then for the forecasting solution no we
1:07:36 didn't have a demo. Mhm. Okay. So, you
1:07:39 just basically need to be able to pitch
1:07:40 this idea and have this idea very clear,
1:07:42 right? So that the investors can already
1:07:44 imagine uh like what are you going to
1:07:49 solve, right?
1:07:50 Yeah. They so they want to see like uh
1:07:52 that the market is big enough.
1:07:54 Mhm.
1:07:55 Uh and that you can you are the right
1:07:57 people for the job. Um and that uh the
1:08:05 yeah you can find clients and uh they
1:08:08 they usually trust you on the tech side.
1:08:10 Mhm.
1:08:11 If you have the credentials for it,
1:08:12 right? So they look rather your CV.
1:08:15 They're not going to make a technical
1:08:16 interview.
1:08:17 Okay, that's good. So you can maybe put
1:08:20 a few things more.
1:08:23 No, that's bad advice. Uh so maybe last
1:08:26 one. Uh how do people find you? Oh,
1:08:29 sure. Uh, so I'm on Twitter at Palino.
1:08:32 Uh, I'm also on LinkedIn. Um, so you can
1:08:35 just search for my name, Carina Palino.
