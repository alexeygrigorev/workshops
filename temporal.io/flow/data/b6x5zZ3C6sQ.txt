0:55 Just one second.
1:02 Okay, I think I'm ready. Do you think
1:04 you're ready?
1:08 Yeah. So,
1:11 this week we'll talk about improving our
1:13 world with analytics. And we have a
1:15 special guest today, Parvati.
1:18 Parvati is a CTO at analytics for a
1:21 better world nonprofit organization
1:23 aiming to use analytic techniques to
1:25 contribute to sustainable development
1:27 goals and she holds a professional
1:29 doctorate degree in data science from
1:31 Einhovven University of Technology.
1:33 Welcome.
1:35 Thank you so much Alexi.
1:37 Yeah. So the questions for today
1:38 interview uh for today's interview were
1:40 prepared by Johanna Bayer. Thanks
1:42 Johanna for your help. And also I would
1:44 like to thank Adonis Stellas for
1:46 introducing us uh and introducing me to
1:49 Parvati. So thanks a lot uh for that and
1:52 uh let's start before we go into our
1:55 main topic of improving our world with
1:57 analytics let's start with your
1:59 background can you tell us about your
2:01 career journey so far? Yeah. So I
2:04 started in uh 2007 in India. I studied
2:07 my bachelor's in electrical electronics
2:09 engineering. Uh and after completing the
2:13 uh bachelor program I really wanted to
2:16 work in renewable energy sector because
2:18 yeah with my background in electrical
2:19 electronics it was a obvious choice for
2:22 me uh to go into renewable sector
2:24 because I was also very passionate about
2:25 sustainable development at that point.
2:28 Even though I didn't know the depth and
2:29 width of this field um being a very
2:33 young graduate so I uh did a masters in
2:35 energy management and climate change
2:37 technology uh I realized that um
2:40 collecting and using data is becoming
2:42 more and more prominent in this field
2:44 and I started learning a lot of modeling
2:47 simulation uh data analysis specifically
2:49 in the energy management sector um and I
2:52 started working in India itself. So I
2:54 worked in research and development
2:56 throughout uh in a few uh research
2:58 institutes in India um predominantly
3:01 working with solar photo voltics uh and
3:03 in the data side uh of that uh I saw a
3:07 really good job opportunity in Singapore
3:09 at that point at the national university
3:11 of Singapore where they were collecting
3:13 a lot of data from crossclimatic
3:15 photovoltaic systems and analyzing it.
3:17 So I jumped at that opportunity to learn
3:19 more about data science and I join uh
3:21 applied and I got in. So I worked there
3:23 for almost uh more than two years. Um
3:26 and then I realized data is not just uh
3:29 usable in renewable energy sector. Uh it
3:32 can be used for other fields in
3:34 sustainability as well. Um and I want
3:36 realized I do not have a education in
3:39 data science. Uh so I uh decided to
3:42 pursue an education there as well. So I
3:44 moved to Netherlands. Uh I pursued a
3:46 professional doctorate program in TU
3:48 Antoven and I'm based currently in
3:50 Antoven in the Netherlands. Um and after
3:52 graduation I started working in the
3:54 public sector. So I started freelancing
3:56 for World Bank and United Nations uh
3:58 specifically UNDP in India on a series
4:01 of uh sustainability projects uh leading
4:04 the data part of it uh across
4:06 healthcare, transportation,
4:07 infrastructure uh and others. And last
4:10 year uh the University of Amsterdam
4:12 together with some private sector
4:14 players decided to set up this analytics
4:16 for a better world institute and they
4:18 were looking for a CTO and uh uh thanks
4:21 to uh my good luck I got the offer and
4:24 last year I started working with them.
4:26 Uh so I still continue to consult for
4:29 both World Bank and UN on a series of
4:31 projects but um yeah majority of my time
4:34 I work as a CTO over there and that's
4:36 basically my career journey. H
4:39 interesting. What do you do there as a
4:40 CTO?
4:42 Uh so uh basically what analytics for a
4:44 better world does is we connect
4:46 nonprofits with research and uh private
4:49 sector uh expertise. So not just
4:52 organization but with expertise. So what
4:54 we see is that many nonprofits have
4:56 questions that sometimes require deep uh
4:58 research but in many cases they require
5:01 uh things to be set up scaled uh develop
5:04 tools dashboards visualization. So for
5:07 that but they internally may not have
5:09 the capability. So what we do at
5:11 analytics for better world is try to
5:13 make this connection and start projects
5:15 for nonprofits either research projects
5:18 or implementation and analytic projects.
5:20 Um and uh I lead some of them. I uh help
5:24 in brainstorming, ideating, coming up
5:26 with uh digital solutions. Also we try
5:29 to understand the maturity of the
5:30 nonprofit and based on that we create a
5:34 tech and a tool set because uh with not
5:36 every nonprofit you can directly go to
5:38 machine learning and deep learning. You
5:40 need to start uh smaller iterate fast
5:43 because that's the only way we can drive
5:45 digital transformation. So uh we start
5:48 from the beginning we ideate. We
5:49 brainstorm. We understand the maturity.
5:51 We have a long-term partnership kind of
5:53 a model of working with nonprofits. Um
5:56 and I deal with most of the technical
5:58 stuff uh data part. Uh we have a
6:00 managing director who looks at more the
6:02 business development um making
6:04 partnerships work uh way of working etc.
6:08 Um so I sometimes lead data projects,
6:10 sometimes lead brainstorming workshops,
6:12 I even create curriculum for uh training
6:15 and upskilling nonprofits and others.
6:20 That's a lot of information I'm trying
6:22 to know. Uh
6:25 so what you do is you connect uh
6:29 nonprofit organizations uh so you help
6:31 nonprofit organizations with analytics
6:33 right and that means you set up all this
6:37 technical infrastructure
6:39 and even before that you do some
6:42 brainstorming sessions with them right
6:43 to understand what they actually need
6:45 what kind of tools they need so maybe we
6:47 can start with these brainstorming
6:49 sessions like let's say a [snorts]
6:51 nonprofit organization comes to you and
6:53 says, "Help us with digital
6:55 transformation." Right? So, how do you
6:58 start that? How do you work with them?
6:59 What things you talk about in these
7:02 brainstorming sessions?
7:04 Um, usually we try to understand the
7:07 different levels of the organization.
7:10 So, uh let's say we can summarize into
7:13 three categories. So, we have uh
7:15 executives who make like uh long-term
7:18 strategy plans for the organization.
7:20 Then there are like managers or project
7:22 leads or program leads or organization
7:25 uh department leads who uh put together
7:27 teams who define and deliver and
7:29 implement projects. Then there is
7:31 hands-on practitioners um who are
7:34 actually implementing uh projects and
7:36 not all nonprofit project is a data
7:38 project. Their goal is let's say to
7:40 deliver humanitarian assistance or to uh
7:43 make sure that schools um in the
7:45 neighborhood have access to uh food,
7:48 electricity. So their goal is totally
7:50 different but they might have a data
7:52 component in their project. So during
7:54 the brainstorm what we try to understand
7:56 is these at these different levels in
7:58 the organization what level of data
8:00 maturity is already existing. Then we
8:03 try to understand what are the things
8:06 that is required in their strategy for
8:08 them to grow in data science. Do they um
8:12 really need to invest in resources? Do
8:14 they need to invest in infrastructure
8:16 like you said or do they need to invest
8:18 in long-term strategy and plan? So we
8:21 try to understand this through a series
8:22 of interviews um with different uh
8:26 groups within the uh team um or
8:29 organization and then we try to come up
8:31 with a road map but also not every or uh
8:35 nonprofit is the same. Some nonprofits
8:37 come to us with a really good already
8:39 defined problem statement. Then we help
8:42 them implement a solution for it. So um
8:44 it totally depends on at what level of
8:47 maturity the nonprofit is and do they
8:49 already have a problem statement? Yes or
8:51 no. So uh yeah I would say it depends on
8:53 the nonprofit but this is uh uh this
8:56 gives you a flavor of how those
8:57 brainstormings work.
8:59 I'm just curious if you I don't know if
9:02 you can tell us or not. Maybe you can
9:04 just pick an example without naming
9:07 maybe organizations or if you can name
9:09 that would be even interesting and then
9:11 a project that you did for them recently
9:13 and uh would be interesting to see like
9:15 how you took it like from uh you know
9:18 from the start and then worked on that
9:21 like define this road map uh did this
9:24 like did this brainstorming defined road
9:25 map and then found a solution.
9:29 Uh yes definitely I can give you one
9:31 example. So uh this is not uh a direct
9:34 example of a project because yeah we
9:36 cannot dive all the information uh due
9:38 to privacy [clears throat] and others
9:40 but uh we recently or last year uh later
9:44 uh part of October we started an academy
9:46 where we uh trained nonprofits and it
9:49 was a open free program where we invited
9:52 nonprofits from around the globe to
9:54 apply uh for practitioners. So uh we
9:57 received more than 340 applications from
9:59 around the globe. Um and we from that we
10:02 selected 43 fellows or nonprofit uh data
10:05 practitioners to work with us uh and go
10:08 through a 8-week program and in the
10:10 first few weeks they did some data
10:12 science courses. Then in the second half
10:15 we did brainstorming with them. In your
10:18 nonprofit let's try to identify a
10:19 problem that you would like to solve. uh
10:21 and I will give one example uh from uh
10:24 the United Nations Environment Program
10:26 in Nairobi, Kenya. So we worked with a
10:29 fellow from there uh who had a problem
10:31 that in Kenya waste management is a huge
10:34 issue and what uh they were seeing on
10:36 the ground was that there were not
10:38 enough um waste collection points
10:40 throughout the city. Uh they wanted to
10:43 use analytics and optimization models to
10:45 understand how can we improve this
10:47 situation. Uh so what we did is we
10:50 paired them up with mentors and uh who
10:52 are already experienced data scientists
10:54 and we paired them up with uh some of
10:56 our trainers from university doing some
10:59 optimization research uh because it
11:01 requires mathematical modeling as well
11:03 and they jointly did a very simple proof
11:06 of concept pilot where they uh used uh
11:09 data what is openly available to say
11:11 population densities uh they overlaid
11:13 the road network data and others to say
11:16 this is where you need to establish more
11:19 more waste collection points. But then
11:21 uh it was an 8 program of course and the
11:24 brainstorming came up with a really
11:25 solid idea to take forward and um now
11:28 what we are doing is we are uh having a
11:31 student plus a small team supporting
11:33 them to scale this up because that was a
11:35 proof of concept. It worked fine as a
11:38 test case but now we are working with
11:39 them to implement it as a proper
11:41 solution even using for example
11:43 satellite imagery to identify large
11:45 scale dumping grounds of waste to see
11:48 maybe in those areas you need not just
11:50 data solution but you might need more
11:52 advocacy for waste segregation and
11:54 plastic waste collection. So uh this is
11:56 one example where we started with just a
11:59 brainstorming and an idea. We went all
12:01 the way to actually now developing a
12:03 solution. And uh I just want to make
12:05 this very clear. The data part is just
12:08 one part of the solution. You have um
12:11 the other parts like you need to have
12:13 public officials, you need to have
12:15 advocacy for better data collection, you
12:17 need to have advocacy for um on the
12:20 ground training for people to actually
12:22 do these segregation. So uh the data
12:24 part is helping the official preach
12:27 there but there is much more beyond that
12:29 to get the solution to work and scale. M
12:33 yeah that's uh and uh probably I don't
12:36 know if I'm right maybe I'm wrong um but
12:40 I expect that the level of maturity when
12:42 it comes to data in these organizations
12:45 in the public sector is probably lower
12:47 compared to I don't know a typical
12:49 startup internet startup right a typical
12:53 u internet company is it the right
12:56 observation what what kind of level of
12:58 maturities maturity data maturity do you
13:01 usually see in these organizations.
13:04 Uh so the it also depends on nonprofits.
13:07 There are some nonprofits or development
13:09 sector organizations that have uh really
13:11 good uh maturity in terms of digital.
13:13 They have like a data science team. Uh
13:16 they might uh already have data
13:18 scientists working with them uh from
13:20 other organizations. They might have
13:21 research teams. But if you look at uh
13:24 the overall landscape, yes, there is a
13:27 uh resource gap. Uh there is a lot of
13:29 need for data scientist in this sector
13:32 and the sector also have huge
13:34 competition with the private sector
13:35 right because private sector have uh a
13:38 lot of need for data scientists as well
13:40 and then the data scientists have an
13:42 option to choose either to work in a
13:43 public or a private sector company and
13:46 um in many cases
13:48 what I see is in a nonprofit uh data is
13:51 not their first order of business like I
13:53 said before their main goal is not to
13:57 collect and analyze is data but their
13:58 goal is something else and data is one
14:00 part of it. So um you need also data
14:03 scientists who have that kind of
14:04 affinity to work with them who
14:06 understands the big picture and not just
14:09 uh start developing machine learning
14:10 every time they see some data set but to
14:12 understand where to contextualize it. So
14:14 there is definitely a resource gap uh
14:17 and there is a huge demand. So this is
14:19 where I uh think I mentioned before from
14:22 our analytics the academy that we set
14:24 up. Um it was our first time setting up
14:26 an academy and we are a new
14:28 organization. We do not have that much
14:30 uh visibility yet. We do have a lot of
14:32 partners and nonprofits working with us
14:34 but uh if you look at it we are
14:36 relatively new. So uh even then we
14:38 received so many applications from top
14:41 uh organizations around the world. So it
14:44 really shows that there is a need. And
14:46 uh one more thing is um it is it was a
14:48 free program and usually free
14:50 educational programs the dropout rate is
14:52 high and the retention because it's a
14:54 8week program there can be very uh less
14:57 number of people who actually graduate
14:59 but that pro problem we did not have at
15:02 all because we really looked at the
15:03 motivation and they fellows were
15:06 motivated throughout the program and
15:07 yeah we had really high uh retention
15:10 rate and attendance plus the pro pro
15:13 program completion rate. So yeah, I have
15:15 to say extremely motivated uh resources
15:18 who are existing but there is a huge uh
15:21 skill gap. Yes.
15:23 And how do you solve this skill gap?
15:24 Because I imagine that like if you
15:27 compare the public sector with the
15:29 private sector u that uh I suspect that
15:33 usual internet companies who are in the
15:35 private sector they probably can pay
15:38 more right and then it's kind of hard to
15:40 compete because like people who I don't
15:42 know graduate from university or people
15:45 who are already experienced they might
15:47 want to go there because already data
15:49 maturity is maybe better there. uh like
15:51 there's better compensation
15:53 um and other things right so how do you
15:57 actually um I don't know manage to close
15:59 this gap manage to find people who want
16:02 to work in the public sector who want to
16:05 contribute um yeah so how do you do this
16:10 uh what we see at least is that uh
16:12 nowadays young people are extremely
16:14 driven by uh purpose not always uh
16:17 financial benefits alone uh and uh I do
16:21 not um I have worked both in private and
16:24 public sector and I wouldn't speak for
16:25 the rest of the world but uh sometimes
16:28 you uh when you are working especially
16:30 in public sector you get that sense of
16:31 purpose much more than when you are
16:33 working in a private sector company uh
16:35 it's not always the same for all
16:37 companies uh disclaimer here but um what
16:41 we try to help uh and I think one
16:45 organization alone cannot solve this
16:47 problem it is a huge problem and uh we
16:49 need partner partnerships and we need
16:51 like a um like a combined effort from
16:55 different organizations to actually
16:56 achieve this. But I can talk about what
16:58 we try to do uh to help. So we have um
17:02 analytics for a better world courses uh
17:04 both here at University of Amsterdam and
17:07 MIT. Actually our uh science to impact
17:10 co-director is currently in Boston
17:11 giving that course. So we do this course
17:13 both at bachelor level and uh mast's
17:16 level. Um and this is for let's say
17:18 training new young people to know that
17:21 there is this field. So everybody is not
17:23 aware that there is this stream that
17:25 they can go uh after they uh do a uh
17:28 program in data science and also to get
17:30 them excited that the problems are
17:32 actually quite mathematically
17:34 challenging as well. It's not
17:36 straightforward problems that we have to
17:37 solve. It's quite um mentally and uh
17:41 like this one
17:42 the one you mentioned about the waste
17:44 management right. It's like it's a very
17:46 difficult problem like where do you
17:47 exactly put these uh waste collectors
17:49 right it's it's a difficult modeling
17:51 problem.
17:52 Yeah it it is and it's very exciting to
17:55 solve it you know it's not just uh from
17:57 the social perspective but as a
17:59 technical person uh I get challenging
18:01 problems I get really excited so uh I we
18:04 as an organization want to inspire young
18:07 people to realize that this is
18:08 definitely possible and there are these
18:10 interesting problems to solve out there.
18:12 Uh secondly, we also see that a lot of
18:15 nonprofits already have people working
18:16 with data. We want to upskill them and
18:20 uh plus we want to get organizations
18:23 also to invest in improving their data
18:25 maturity because like you said before uh
18:27 a lot of data scientists need to feel
18:29 that they are working in a more uh
18:31 mature organization to understand uh
18:34 that how they can com uh like contribute
18:36 and they need to have all the tools and
18:38 techniques and support to develop these
18:40 solutions. Right? So that's exactly why
18:42 I mentioned these three levels. So we
18:44 have executives, we have uh managers or
18:47 analytics translators uh very commonly
18:49 used word. Then we have data science
18:51 practitioners. So at analytics for a
18:53 better world we have have an academy and
18:56 through academy we last year hosted a
18:58 program for uh practitioners which is
19:01 hands-on data science skills. This year
19:03 we will repeat that cohort plus we are
19:05 adding a new course for analytics
19:07 translators and in the pipeline for next
19:10 year we have plans to uh like post a
19:14 program for uh executives as well but uh
19:17 we need some more preparation time for
19:18 it because for practitioners we have
19:20 eight weeks for analytics translators
19:23 it's going to be a shorter program and
19:24 for executives it have to be two days or
19:26 so because yeah getting them uh engaged
19:29 for more so uh the curriculum requires
19:31 more research and that's exactly ly what
19:33 we are doing now we are uh planning to
19:35 interview a lot of executives who are
19:37 working in the nonprofits uh to develop
19:39 their curriculum uh it is also difficult
19:42 to set up a curriculum for them because
19:44 if you look at I mean you you probably
19:46 know uh there is Corsera Udemy there is
19:49 so much data science content out there
19:51 but how do we tailor it for nonprofits
19:53 and how do we tailor a curriculum which
19:56 speaks to them and their language uh
19:58 it's also not uh very easy so we are
20:00 also learning in the process last last
20:02 year was a success and we are very happy
20:04 for that but uh we can still improve and
20:06 we are working on uh doing much research
20:08 into developing such a curriculum for
20:10 these three levels within organizations.
20:13 Mhm. So as I understood like maybe in
20:15 summary you solve the skill gap by
20:18 education and you educate people at
20:21 different levels. you start with the
20:23 students uh from universities like MIAT
20:25 and University of Amsterdam but then you
20:28 also work with the companies upskilling
20:31 people there on all the three levels
20:32 that you mentioned and I'm wondering
20:37 so you create a lot of educational
20:39 content is any of this content publicly
20:42 available do you have like maybe courses
20:44 from MIT or University of Amsterdam
20:47 somewhere in public
20:50 so we are a huge proponents of open
20:52 source uh as you can probably uh imagine
20:55 that's the whole purpose of this uh so
20:58 whatever we develop for example for the
21:00 fellowship uh most of the lectures you
21:02 can find in YouTube uh channel of ours
21:05 uh where uh of course the interactive
21:07 sessions and the mentoring cannot be
21:09 captured completely but the courses are
21:11 there uh many of the lecturers from our
21:14 um from the uh bachelor's and masters
21:17 program they give workshops also
21:20 specifically about these for students.
21:22 Uh we also like do a lot of showcase of
21:25 our projects uh for people to see and it
21:27 is all available in open domain. And if
21:30 I can add one more thing not just about
21:31 the academy but we also have a GitHub
21:34 repository where whatever we are
21:35 developing uh for um nonprofits not the
21:40 data of course the data is proprietary
21:41 and it stays with the nonprofit but the
21:44 algorithms and models if we see it is
21:46 applicable for other use cases we make
21:48 them also openly available and we try
21:51 not to use proprietary tools in general
21:53 but in some cases we cannot um escape
21:57 but in most of the cases we try to uh
22:00 use open source and both knowledge and
22:03 uh any deliverables or results we openly
22:06 make avail available.
22:07 That's really cool. So please send us
22:09 the links uh to these resources so we
22:11 will include them in the show notes. But
22:14 I'm wondering maybe you can tell us more
22:15 about these courses that you have with
22:17 universities. So like what kind of
22:20 modules do you have there? What what is
22:22 the focus? Uh what do you teach there?
22:25 Uh so I do not teach myself. we have a
22:28 science to impact co-directors two
22:31 professors so one is uh professor
22:33 Dimitris Bertimus he's from MIT Sloan
22:35 school of management and then of course
22:37 in Amsterdam we have professor dict her
22:39 dog so they are the ones who are uh
22:41 leading let's say most of the
22:43 educational programs in universities and
22:45 we have other professors like Joakim
22:47 Groicho who also uh takes sessions uh so
22:51 it's not just us we have a big extended
22:54 team behind us who does these courses uh
22:56 just to give you In a nutshell what the
22:58 courses um um talk about if you look at
23:02 the data analytics um ascendancy metrics
23:05 as we call it you usually start with
23:07 descriptive analytics which is just
23:09 knowing what is happening and you
23:11 visualize you um uh get some data clean
23:15 all those things then you do diagnostic
23:17 analysis where you see why things happen
23:19 and what are the root causes then you
23:22 can do prediction so you can forecast
23:25 you can create early warning systems
23:27 You can um make machine learning models.
23:29 You can do some uh image detection,
23:32 geospatial analysis. But the last step
23:34 which is quite difficult and it is more
23:37 impactful is optimization which is
23:41 talking about how can we make things
23:43 better. So I will give you a very uh
23:45 quick example of what we did with World
23:47 Bank um or what we are actually doing
23:49 now also continuing to do with World
23:51 Bank. Um we went to Timalstee together
23:56 with World Bank to study how the current
23:59 uh hospital network in Timst is and do
24:01 people actually have access to primary
24:03 healthcare centers. So we make a map of
24:06 all the population points. We map the
24:08 existing hospitals. We map roads. Then
24:11 we calculate the travel distances and we
24:14 see at 5 kilometers, 10 km, 15
24:16 kilometers, how many people or what
24:18 percentage of people have access. Now
24:20 this is uh descriptive basically you
24:24 have just the know the asset scenario
24:26 but then we try to do some more analysis
24:29 to see why it is so is it just the road
24:32 network is it new hospitals are required
24:35 but then the last step is the
24:38 prescriptive part where we are actually
24:40 using a mathematical model to say where
24:42 do you place new hospitals now that is
24:45 the decision-m point because uh knowing
24:49 all the previous steps is necessary to
24:51 make that decision. But that model, the
24:53 optimization model is what will give you
24:56 the decision-m capability saying that
24:58 put a hospital in this county or a
25:00 subcount to give access to x% more
25:03 population and this is going to cost you
25:06 so much. If you had five more, you go
25:08 from 50 to 100%. Just example of course,
25:11 but giving that power is what uh we try
25:14 to incorporate into all our training
25:17 programs. So how you can actually go
25:19 from descriptive and diagnostic to this
25:23 optimization model and how you can use
25:26 uh mathematics or uh others to actually
25:29 come up with that decision-m capability.
25:31 Uh I think that is summarizes the core
25:33 of all our training programs.
25:35 Mhm. So from what I understood um like
25:39 of course like you have multiple you
25:41 have multiple training pro programs uh
25:44 and they each of them have a different
25:47 um target audience right but the ones um
25:52 in these universities MIAT and
25:54 University of Amsterdam who is the main
25:57 target audience uh is it people who I
26:01 don't know who study management or is it
26:03 people who study data science and
26:05 analytics X uh like are they more
26:07 technical are they less technical?
26:09 [sighs]
26:10 Um that's a good question. They are
26:12 technical. Uh so we have uh for example
26:15 uh MBA in big data uh program that's an
26:18 MBA program but they have a big data uh
26:20 component. So they do learn uh some of
26:22 this. Uh we also have a business
26:24 analytics course uh both here and uh at
26:27 MIT the Sloan School of Management. So
26:30 uh these are the kind of uh students who
26:32 take up these courses. But we are also
26:34 uh have been brainstorming it's not done
26:37 yet is on seeing if um health care or
26:40 education or uh these kind of programs
26:43 can also have such components but uh
26:45 yeah that's uh just an idea at this
26:48 point. Uh but uh like you ask in
26:51 universities most of our courses are
26:53 targeting students who are learning
26:55 business analytics or um MBA in big
26:58 data. So a link of both management as
27:00 well as uh technical.
27:02 Yeah. So they already know analytics and
27:04 you just show them the application of
27:06 analytics from well for uh nonprofits
27:11 right for
27:12 nonprofits and also maybe a more of
27:14 optimization kind of problem. So we
27:17 teach them more prescriptive uh
27:19 analytics.
27:20 Yes. But the the point is that they
27:22 already know analytics. You just show
27:23 them uh how they can apply this to solve
27:26 real world problems.
27:29 Okay. That must be quite inspiring I
27:31 imagine.
27:33 Yeah.
27:33 Yeah. That's the feedback we get from
27:35 students. They are all very excited and
27:37 we have a lot of them working with
27:39 nonprofits during their thesis as well.
27:41 So that shows that yeah they get do get
27:44 inspired and they want to work with
27:45 nonprofits for their thesis and
27:48 interestingly we also get uh requests
27:50 from other students who are not really
27:52 from these programs uh writing to us
27:55 asking if they can do thesis with us and
27:58 yeah uh we do encourage that as well. uh
28:01 so these are not just open to University
28:03 of Amsterdam or MIT or any of your
28:06 affiliate let's say universities we do
28:09 encourage other students also to come
28:10 and work with us do their thesis
28:13 um yeah to see how
28:16 it's actually u like um I see this
28:21 question coming up in the community in
28:23 Slack quite often people come and ask
28:26 hey I need to write a thesis but I have
28:28 no idea what to write about can you
28:30 suggest good topics and yeah so maybe
28:34 for these people for these students who
28:36 come and ask these questions
28:38 how can they contact you and so and find
28:41 out uh how they can help with their
28:43 skills how can they take part in this
28:46 what's the best way of doing this maybe
28:48 you have like a a public list somewhere
28:51 with possible topics
28:53 or like how do they go about this
28:56 yeah actually this is not that uh let's
28:58 say
28:59 structure straightforward because we
29:01 usually define it together with
29:03 nonprofits
29:04 and the problem can evolve over time. So
29:06 it's not like there is a list somewhere
29:08 and people just choose uh it have to be
29:10 a it is a bit more personal uh let's say
29:14 um just to give one example so we have a
29:17 student who says we want to do thesis
29:18 with that uh with us then we know that
29:20 our some of our nonprofits have some
29:22 pressing issues uh we send the student
29:25 and the nonprofit uh in a brainstorming
29:27 together with us to define a problem
29:29 statement which works for both of them
29:31 because it's not just that uh it should
29:34 match what the nonprofit want it should
29:35 also appeal to the students
29:38 because they are investing a lot of
29:39 time. We want them to get excited about
29:41 it as well and passionate. So, uh I
29:44 wouldn't say it is that uh
29:46 industrialized yet where they can choose
29:48 but they can always reach out to us. Uh
29:50 in our uh website we have a uh page
29:54 specifically for researchers and
29:55 students where they can just write a
29:57 message. We always get back to them or
30:00 uh I think you have our LinkedIn um
30:02 page, you have my LinkedIn, Robert's
30:05 LinkedIn. you can just reach out to us.
30:07 We are always um yeah open to all these
30:10 uh we are not that busy that we don't uh
30:12 have time to answer these. So just reach
30:14 out to us personally.
30:16 Yeah. So we'll make sure to include all
30:18 the links you send us. So what I
30:20 understood if I don't know there's
30:21 somebody a student in India or in
30:24 Germany or any other country which is I
30:27 don't know not from any university which
30:30 is not MIT or University of Amsterdam.
30:32 If there is a student and if they want
30:34 to write a thesis with you, what they do
30:37 is they go to your website. There is a
30:39 section um for students and researchers
30:41 and they simply contact you, right? And
30:43 then you take it from there.
30:45 Cool.
30:46 Sounds good.
30:47 Yeah. Okay. And I want to go uh back a
30:50 bit. So when we discussed your different
30:53 uh educational initiatives and one
30:55 things you one of the things you
30:58 mentioned was that uh you want to
31:00 improve data maturity [snorts] of
31:02 existing organizations and you do this
31:04 by upskilling people and perhaps
31:06 something more. So I'm really curious
31:08 how exactly you go about this. So you
31:10 come you join or you work with an
31:12 organization and you see that yeah the
31:14 data maturity uh could be improved. So
31:17 what are your next steps? What do you do
31:18 for that?
31:20 Uh so first we need to measure to
31:22 actually improve right so we do some
31:24 series of interviews like I said we also
31:27 have um standard questionnaires standard
31:29 formats of these uh uh measuring the
31:32 maturity let's say and then uh using
31:35 that template we say okay currently you
31:37 are here in terms of people or process
31:39 in technology so it is not just uh about
31:42 technology it's about the process and
31:44 people as well then together with the
31:46 management they we look at their
31:48 strategy for uh next uh one year, three
31:51 year, five year then we say that uh
31:53 based on this strategy this is the road
31:55 map. So we help them create a road map
31:57 for data and digital uh transformation.
31:59 So you need to upskill um people around
32:02 these sectors. These are the uh options
32:05 for uh fundraising. These are the
32:06 training programs. Um also these are the
32:10 tools that you can internally use to um
32:13 uh maximize operational efficiency
32:16 because sometimes um we see that a
32:19 process is not correct. They have set up
32:22 something but it needs uh some
32:24 optimization there then we uh help them
32:26 set it up. So uh it's not just about
32:28 training but it goes much beyond that.
32:31 Um I can give one example without naming
32:34 the nonprofit is that we saw in the
32:36 nonprofit that there is already a uh a
32:39 sure cloud environment set up but there
32:41 were configurations which are which were
32:43 actually um like not optimized that they
32:47 are spending more money than what is
32:50 necessary. A lot of the unused uh
32:52 resources or clusters were not turned
32:54 off or uh they are still running which
32:57 is running up cost. So uh there also we
33:00 have to first of all shut them down
33:02 reduce cost but also come up with a
33:05 standard operating procedure so that
33:07 next time any team in the organization
33:10 set it up they follow a set of criteria
33:12 you know if you are no no longer using
33:14 it uh you this is what you have to do.
33:16 So it's not just about shutting it down
33:18 optimizing you have to document it and
33:21 make them aware that yeah these are
33:23 these are the standard operating
33:24 procedures. So um and it is uh again I
33:28 have to go back to what I was uh saying
33:30 it's totally dependent on the nonprofit.
33:33 Uh some nonprofits require more
33:35 investments in people, some more in
33:37 technology. Um but yeah, we kind of try
33:41 to tailor it to the uh nonprofit uh the
33:44 whole process but usually maturity scan
33:47 uh discussions uh and then we create a
33:50 road map. We help them implement the
33:52 road map in stages. So it's not like at
33:54 once you come and change the whole
33:56 organization. It's a long process. Uh
33:59 usually we have like short-term goals
34:01 and long-term goals in the road map and
34:03 we implement it in uh pieces.
34:06 So yeah you mentioned three aspects or
34:08 three dimensions uh that you measure
34:10 during the interview. So people,
34:12 processes and technology maybe can you
34:16 give us a little bit more insight into
34:19 what exactly you measure there like in
34:21 terms of you know people processes and
34:23 tech what exactly you look at
34:27 like you said if the strategy of an
34:29 organization let's say is to uh collect
34:32 uh and analyze more health related
34:34 indicators just uh one example they are
34:36 working in the ground with health care
34:39 professionals and um hospitals uh we
34:42 look at are they collecting the right
34:45 amount of data are they uh having the
34:48 capacity to analyze this data so that is
34:50 where resources
34:51 so it's the tech part or people part or
34:53 process part
34:54 it's actually uh let's start with the
34:57 people part
34:58 so if you look at people so they need
35:00 people who know how to collect the right
35:03 amount of data people who know how to uh
35:06 uh structure the questions let's say or
35:08 even uh set up that uh collection uh
35:11 system or a mobile app to collect this
35:14 data.
35:15 It's like researchers, right? Like
35:17 social scientists or uh people who have
35:20 this background of doing uh you know
35:23 asking questions and making sure they
35:25 are not biased and all that stuff,
35:27 right?
35:28 Yeah. Plus you need uh some technical
35:30 experts or uh data science people who
35:33 can help them create or um um web app
35:37 and connect it via an API to an
35:39 analytics part. So it have to be a team.
35:42 So including let's say people who can uh
35:46 set up the questionnaire but also
35:47 digitally collect the information put it
35:49 into a uh server somewhere host it. So
35:53 you need a team who can do all this
35:55 right. So that is people part but um
35:58 so if they have a team then they are
35:59 already more or less mature. If there is
36:02 no team then you understand okay there
36:03 is a gap because if you want to collect
36:05 data how are you going to do this if
36:07 there are no people who know how to do
36:09 this right? [sighs and gasps]
36:11 Yeah. Uh and let's say there there are
36:13 people who can collect data but there is
36:16 no analytics capability who can analyze
36:18 this data to make decisions then they
36:20 are at a different stage in the
36:22 maturity. Um but if they don't have any
36:25 data collection at all then they are at
36:27 an different stage. If they do
36:28 everything then they are totally at a
36:31 different stage. So there is group
36:33 groups of categories. Yeah.
36:34 Mhm. Understand? Okay. And then the
36:37 process part what is there?
36:39 Uh so in the process part we look at uh
36:41 what are what is the process that the um
36:44 team have to go through to set up the
36:46 system. So organizationally do they have
36:48 all the support required? Um uh are they
36:52 actually looking at the privacy
36:54 security? Uh are they following all the
36:56 best practices uh out there? So you can
36:59 create a form uh uh anybody can create a
37:02 form but are they actually following the
37:03 best practices? Um are they following
37:07 the right uh order of things? For
37:09 example, before collecting a form, is
37:11 there a clear guidance from the uh
37:14 management or from the team who needs
37:17 this data uh on h why they want to use
37:20 this data. So you need to have that
37:22 process clearly defined and in stages.
37:25 So uh yeah they know uh that they are
37:28 doing the right thing at the right
37:29 order. So that would be the process.
37:33 So zero processes means low maturity
37:37 right then if there are some processes
37:39 then it's like I don't know mid-level
37:41 and if there is a process that explains
37:42 everything like uh I think you mentioned
37:45 the standard operating procedures right
37:47 if they have these things in place if
37:49 everyone knows how exactly to I don't
37:50 know uh collect data or process data or
37:55 I don't know delete things that are not
37:57 used like what what are the sequences
38:00 what is the sequence of steps you need
38:02 to do then it's good right? Yeah, it's
38:06 you you are saying three three
38:08 categories but there is much more. It's
38:10 not that crisp, right? It's fussy. Uh so
38:13 uh yeah it is not just three levels
38:15 there is like a a whole level of
38:16 maturity scan but you are right in the
38:19 overall picture. Yes.
38:21 Mhm. And then the tech part I guess uh
38:24 also quite interesting. Uh you mentioned
38:26 cloud at some point right? So what are
38:28 the stages there in the tech dimension?
38:32 Uh so in the text uh Ben I would say uh
38:35 do they have let's say a collaborative
38:37 kind of working uh style because in many
38:41 cases you will be working yeah like git
38:44 of course but are they all working in
38:46 their local machines having local copies
38:48 of the data or do they have a
38:50 centralized one source of truth is uh
38:53 everything accessible is the tech
38:56 configured properly uh do they and also
38:59 from the organizational side are they
39:01 aware of the technologies that they
39:02 require um from the management and we
39:06 look at uh that as well like in terms of
39:09 technology uh not just whether they are
39:11 using it but are they aware of uh what
39:14 are the alternatives and they have
39:15 chosen something that is best and we
39:18 look at their tech stack we look at
39:19 their uh analytic stack and see uh if
39:22 something needs to be optimized so that
39:24 will be technology
39:26 and uh yeah I kind of wanted to use this
39:30 as a segue to talk about different
39:32 technologies and analytical tools. Uh so
39:36 what are the tools that you typically
39:37 see or typically recommend your clients
39:40 to use? How do you go about u you know
39:45 suggesting these tools to the customers?
39:47 U yeah
39:50 uh that also depends on the maturity of
39:52 the organization but uh we have a few
39:54 set of categories let's say. So uh if we
39:57 are looking at uh data visualization, we
40:00 do not usually make decisions uh for the
40:03 nonprofits but we give them the options
40:04 and the pros and cons of each if they
40:07 don't have anything. Let's say uh uh
40:09 just let's take the example of data
40:11 visualization. So uh within the
40:13 organization if they want to make uh
40:15 dashboards many organizations prefer one
40:18 platform which they already are using
40:20 and they are aware of like PowerBI or
40:22 Tableau uh so they already have
40:24 capabilities to use it. Then we try to
40:26 upskilling them in that itself because
40:29 usually they have a shared platform and
40:32 the organization have invested in it. So
40:34 we try to upskill them in that. As an
40:36 organization we do not have priorities
40:38 for any technology. Uh to be very fair.
40:42 We look at the organ nonprofit and see
40:44 if they already have capabilities in
40:46 something then we try to uh identify
40:49 from our side people who can help the
40:51 nonprofit in those uh technologies. And
40:54 when you say technologies um we also try
40:57 to tell them uh if there are open-source
41:00 alternatives or um tools like for
41:03 example Python or uh others that are
41:06 very easy to configure for data
41:08 scientist but then connect them to good
41:11 visualization and dashboarding so that
41:13 the managers and executives don't get
41:16 too overwhelmed with the results that
41:18 they don't they are afraid to take
41:20 decisions. So um from the technology
41:22 point of view we see a lot of
41:24 dashboarding because uh many
41:26 organizations are at the maturity let's
41:28 say uh beginning their transformation
41:30 journey. So they are still exploring and
41:32 visualizing data. uh and when we need to
41:35 do machine learning or predictions we
41:37 prefer uh Python or R depending on the
41:41 organization and then when we have to
41:43 develop a product uh and deploy it we uh
41:46 suggest them different cloud options
41:48 like Azure or AWS GCP and then we uh see
41:51 which fits the organization best and
41:54 many nonprofits already uh have such uh
41:57 environment setup then we try to stick
41:59 with that and go with that instead of
42:01 changing the entire thing because like I
42:03 said we do not really have any
42:04 priorities. Uh and um just to add uh
42:08 from the technology point of view, we
42:10 see a lot of nonprofits have different
42:13 types of data. So it's not always like
42:15 just um Excel file with so many rows or
42:19 data frames. They have a lot of
42:20 geospatial data. They have a lot of text
42:22 uh data. So uh to handle these you they
42:26 might need different technologies. For
42:28 example, uh for geospatial data, they
42:30 might need more knowledge in uh
42:32 platforms like QGIS and for text mining
42:35 in Python itself, they need to know more
42:37 about packages which are especially
42:39 dealing with uh text. So um yeah, we try
42:43 to identify that as well and then uh
42:47 suggest them a text which will fit their
42:49 requirements.
42:51 Okay. Yeah. So just to maybe summarize
42:54 uh you mentioned multiple categories. So
42:56 you mentioned databilization, it could
42:58 be tools like power, PowerBI, Tableau,
43:01 some open source alternatives. Then you
43:03 also mentioned machine learning and then
43:05 you suggest to go with things like
43:07 Python or Python packages and R. Then
43:11 you also mentioned cloud. Uh this is as
43:13 a way to deploy these machine learning
43:15 solutions and then you mentioned like
43:17 Azure and others. What are the other
43:20 categories? uh I think you mentioned
43:22 like this a few specific examples like
43:24 geospatial data, text data then for them
43:27 you have like specific tools do you have
43:29 any other categories like I don't know
43:31 when it comes to maybe collecting data
43:34 or storing data
43:36 u or something like that
43:41 uh so we usually see these uh categories
43:44 currently in the nonprofits like uh
43:46 dashboarding visualization we have uh
43:49 Python R uh And of course for uh
43:52 deployment but uh by other technologies
43:56 do you mean like uh like defining
43:59 technologies or defining categories?
44:00 What exactly?
44:01 What categories? What kind of categories
44:03 are there? Categories are there because
44:04 I imagine that you need to keep the data
44:06 somewhere. Maybe you have like some data
44:08 warehousing solutions or maybe you need
44:10 to collect data. You need some data
44:12 tracking solutions or I don't know like
44:15 what are the categories you look at?
44:17 [sighs]
44:18 uh so data warehousing and uh let's say
44:21 storing data there also we uh a lot of
44:24 nonprofits use like open uh prefer let's
44:28 say open platforms and there are
44:30 solutions specifically made for
44:32 nonprofits so they tend to use that um
44:35 and we see a lot of like postresql
44:38 databases because yeah it's uh open uh
44:41 we also see like coobo toolbox being
44:44 used actually it is a digital public
44:45 good uh it is meant for nonprofits to
44:48 collect data in structured formats even
44:51 including images and store it securely
44:54 and they coobbo toolbox have a
44:56 humanitarian um section which deals
44:59 specifically for nonprofits and it's an
45:01 it is registered in the digital public
45:03 good registry. Um so uh there are
45:07 specific tools that nonprofits do use
45:09 and prefer and they are specifically
45:11 targeted and made for them which is
45:13 amazing and they all follow like uh what
45:16 we call the nine principles of digital
45:18 development. Uh uh yeah that's one of
45:21 the resources that maybe uh the viewers
45:23 are also interested to see. It's about
45:26 um developing solutions that can scale
45:28 for specifically in the public and
45:30 nonprofit sector. So uh yeah there are
45:32 there are tools like coobo toolbox uh
45:36 that are uh very frequently used and uh
45:40 also uh tools like like I said for data
45:43 collection uh and databases they use
45:46 like postresql quite frequently as well
45:50 but I'm wondering what kind of profiles
45:53 like for these tools I imagine that you
45:55 need different profiles I
45:56 [clears throat] know data analysts would
45:58 be usually more involved in data
46:01 visization visualization and doing anal
46:04 like using these data storage databases
46:07 like posgress to analyze the data uh
46:09 maybe also collect data then perhaps the
46:12 data scientist profile u the data
46:15 scientists are more involved in I don't
46:17 know machine learning training models
46:19 also getting data uh deploying them to
46:21 the cloud um right do you have other
46:24 profiles like I don't know data
46:25 engineers or deployment engineers or
46:29 some other uh other people who are also
46:32 in the data world.
46:35 Um so it is also totally dependent on
46:38 the nonprofits but many of them that we
46:41 see uh if they are at the lower levels
46:43 of maturity you see a lot of unicorns
46:46 let's say uh they try to do everything
46:49 because like there is a resource gap
46:51 right so uh there is and a lot these
46:54 these words right data scientists data
46:56 analysts data engineers architects cloud
46:59 engineers MLOps these are all like
47:03 somehow merged together. There is not a
47:05 clear definition. I think even in
47:06 private sector companies, not always. Uh
47:09 so um yeah, it is not always very uh
47:12 clear what uh roles are there. But if
47:15 you look at a particular project, uh uh
47:18 I can tell you uh there will always be
47:21 um in a team there is always people uh
47:24 who are let's say collecting analyzing
47:27 data. Um there is always like uh people
47:31 who try to make business decisions out
47:33 of data, right? Um who are trying to uh
47:37 uh understand what these models are
47:39 saying in the uh and putting it into the
47:40 context of operations. And usually uh in
47:44 nonprofits we see a lot of research uh
47:46 teams who are uh looking at uh it from a
47:50 totally different like research
47:52 perspective because uh they need to know
47:54 what more data have to be collected and
47:57 what more uh use cases can be developed.
48:00 So um we see a lot of data science uh
48:04 profiles uh but to be very fair most of
48:08 the nonprofits are not at the stage
48:10 where they are deploying like large
48:12 scale machine learning models on cloud.
48:14 It it's just not there yet. At least
48:16 with the nonprofits we work with or the
48:18 development sector organizations we work
48:20 with. This is not what we see. Um most
48:22 of them are still trying to figure out
48:25 um or defining uh key performance
48:27 indicators. So it's still descriptive uh
48:31 some cases predictive uh just one
48:34 example is uh early warning system. So
48:36 uh you might have heard the great horn
48:39 of Africa have had the biggest drought
48:41 in many many years. Uh and uh how can
48:44 you predict or give early warning for
48:46 these kind of situations? So governments
48:48 can act way well in advance. So early
48:51 warning systems, a lot of um prediction
48:54 on weather, climate using satellite
48:56 based observations and historic data. So
48:59 a lot of these things are done. Um but
49:03 when it comes to deploying to scale like
49:05 large scale models, I do not see a lot
49:08 of such applications. So I don't see
49:10 right now like lot of MLOps cloud
49:12 architects in this sector uh yet.
49:15 Understand? Well, the reason I'm asking
49:18 about this is right now we have a
49:20 course. It's happening right now. We are
49:23 on week four. The course is about data
49:25 engineering. So in this course we show
49:28 how to [snorts] use uh
49:30 different tools for collecting, storing
49:33 and processing data. Uh so the focus is
49:36 more like how do you move data from one
49:38 place to another place in a reliable uh
49:41 and repeatable way reproducible and then
49:44 like as a part of the project they will
49:46 need to do a dashboard and yeah so what
49:50 I want to ask is um like people with
49:53 this kind of profile if they want to
49:56 take part in some of your initiatives um
49:59 how can they do this or do you even need
50:02 people with this kind of skills?
50:06 uh we do need them definitely but it is
50:09 not like uh nonprofits are going to
50:11 directly hire them because it's not like
50:13 there is a constant source of not all
50:16 nonprofits let's say there are some who
50:18 require this but uh because there is no
50:20 constant source of these kind of
50:22 projects right but we do see uh some of
50:26 these applications and uh I can give you
50:28 one very simple example so we worked
50:30 with a researcher who have developed a
50:33 very amazing amazing solution for small
50:34 holder farmers in Brazil. Um, and what
50:37 we want to do is take and it's a very
50:40 impactful model they have uh
50:42 demonstrated on the ground. But how do
50:44 you build that gap between research and
50:46 then scaling it and deploying it is we
50:49 want to create like a like a mobile
50:52 application that will fetch all the
50:54 required data and process it immediately
50:56 give results so that they can
50:58 immediately act on it. And this have to
50:59 happen in a um uh because it's not just
51:03 a visualization. We are running machine
51:06 learning models at the back to give
51:07 those results. Right? So we we were
51:10 looking for the right set of people to
51:12 uh support such a project. Another
51:14 example uh I told you in tumal estee uh
51:18 we went and we uh were optimizing for
51:20 the location of healthcare facilities
51:22 right and we see that a lot of these use
51:24 cases recurrently appear. For example,
51:27 um we worked together with the World
51:29 Health Organization during the COVID
51:31 pandemic in Nepal and they wanted to
51:34 know where should we place um uh COVID
51:37 test labs. So it's a similar problem to
51:40 what Tim Himal State did but the data
51:42 stack is different. So we are actually
51:44 building a web application where in the
51:46 back end these optimization models will
51:48 run and give you results depending on
51:50 the data and the country that you feed.
51:52 And for bigger countries it is actually
51:54 a very resource inensive problem because
51:56 if you look at Vietnam we try to do this
51:59 in Vietnam for uh hospital healthcare
52:01 facility access the population is huge
52:03 it's a large area to run this
52:05 optimization model it it it requires a
52:07 lot of resources right so um yeah we do
52:10 need machine learning engineers for
52:12 specific projects and we need uh these
52:15 deployment capabilities and we always uh
52:17 are looking for uh yeah uh such people
52:20 who want to join this mission.
52:22 But also be aware that this is not like
52:24 constantly we are looking for these
52:26 resources. It comes when such
52:28 interesting projects come uh come to us.
52:31 Mhm. Do you have any open positions
52:33 right now?
52:35 Um
52:36 not necessarily data engineering but
52:38 data analytics too because there is a
52:40 question uh if you have any if there
52:44 will be in the future any open positions
52:45 but I guess you can also talk about if
52:47 you have them now. uh right now uh no
52:51 not as far as uh not until today morning
52:55 let's say things change very fast but um
52:58 what we also try to do is we have a a
53:01 list of uh people and resources who we
53:03 can tap into so when a project come we
53:05 can reach out to them but also uh like I
53:07 said we have a lot of private sector
53:09 organizations who are our partners so
53:12 one of the examples is and is one of the
53:16 founding partners of analytics for a
53:17 better world together with University of
53:19 Amsterdam. They are mathematical uh they
53:22 are a mathematical optimization company.
53:24 We also have uh are currently working
53:26 with a lot of other organizations who
53:28 support us. And when such requirements
53:30 come, we first reach out to them and see
53:33 do you have resources who can work on
53:35 this project for four months or five
53:37 months or sometimes one week or two week
53:40 depending on the project of course. Um
53:42 but we would really love to welcome
53:44 others who would like to contribute uh
53:46 as well and see uh if we can work
53:49 together and uh yeah I'm always looking
53:51 for opportunities to connect with people
53:54 who are inspired to join us
53:58 and uh this is the same question the
54:00 first part of this how many data
54:01 analysts current currently work uh at
54:04 analytics for a better world
54:06 uh like I said we are very new last year
54:09 we set up and uh We currently have a
54:12 core team of uh let's say four people
54:16 core team. So we have managing director
54:19 Robert. I'm the CTO. We have professor
54:21 dict and professor Dimitris from uh they
54:25 are uh co-chairing or they are co-h
54:28 science to impact co-directors and they
54:30 lead research academy and others. Um we
54:33 also have other data scientists uh who
54:35 are working like kind of full-time with
54:37 us. One is Claudia. She's based in
54:39 University of Amsterdam. Uh we have Brit
54:42 who's a PhD student. We also have other
54:45 researchers supporting us. But we are a
54:46 very small core team. But we have a huge
54:49 extended uh team of researchers from
54:52 universities. Uh we have uh supporters
54:55 from our um organizations that are
54:58 supporting us. So just to give an
54:59 example uh during the academy we had um
55:02 more than 20 uh professionals from
55:06 private sector giving courses. So all of
55:09 them came from our uh network uh from
55:11 the people who are uh in organizations
55:14 and if I can look at the number of
55:16 projects we currently have around um
55:18 running parallelly like four or five and
55:22 all of them are um staffed with like uh
55:25 three or four but it's not always data
55:27 scientists. We have sometimes data
55:28 scientists, data engineers and others.
55:30 So we do have a extended network and a
55:33 big team but our core team is very
55:35 small.
55:37 Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. And then we have a
55:39 question from Adonius, but I should have
55:42 asked this question earlier, so I don't
55:44 know if you'll be able to answer it in 2
55:46 minutes, but we can try. So the question
55:49 is, which are the most important factors
55:51 that help organizations become more
55:54 datadriven? Organizations that you
55:56 worked with and organizations that um
55:59 perhaps start from zero from zero data
56:02 maturity and then eventually become
56:04 datadriven. So what are the most
56:06 important factors that help them?
56:08 Um I think long-term strategy to include
56:12 data in their uh portfolio because um
56:18 you ask what are the factors if I have
56:20 to explain that two minutes is not
56:22 enough. So I'll tell you what is the
56:23 main factor that we see is that uh
56:26 organizations which have a strategy of
56:29 um and an understanding that data is
56:32 required are motivated to come up with
56:34 projects and come want to upskill their
56:37 uh people to become more uh data
56:39 intensive in their work. um and they
56:42 need to make the right investments and
56:44 for investments you need drive uh also
56:46 from the organization perspective and
56:49 like I said before the investments have
56:51 to be in three steps right people
56:53 process and it's not steps but in three
56:56 sectors people process and technology
56:58 and understanding this as an
57:00 organization um is the most important
57:03 thing because we see a lot of value in
57:06 data and analytics being added from into
57:08 the public sector organization and we
57:10 believe truly uh from what we have seen
57:13 in the last year an uh nonprofits can
57:15 benefit equally from data but uh as an
57:18 organization they know most of them know
57:21 that data is important but do not have
57:24 made it a strategic part of their goal
57:27 yet u in many cases. So I think that uh
57:30 that clear vision and strategy to
57:32 include data is the first step. After
57:35 that comes all the investments on people
57:36 process technology and um clear
57:40 understanding of uh why and how data can
57:43 be used and that's what we try to do
57:45 with our academy uh yeah making them
57:48 realize how can data help that's not
57:50 always very obvious I think and you
57:53 don't immediately see results right uh
57:55 especially in nonprofits you cannot see
57:58 uh the health care system in a country
57:59 improving in one day it takes uh years
58:02 to show real impact of course there our
58:04 output and outcomes from programs and
58:07 upskilling initiatives but to see the
58:09 change it takes time so to have that
58:11 patience and long-term vision is uh
58:13 equally important and thanks for the
58:15 question it's a really good good one but
58:18 I wish I had more time to
58:20 yeah I should have uh asked that a bit
58:22 earlier u maybe the last one so this is
58:27 usually the question I ask everyone is
58:29 if you have any good book or resource
58:32 that you can recommend to the listeners
58:34 I think one thing is you mentioned all
58:36 these educational initiatives that you
58:39 have that would be a great resource that
58:41 you probably can recommend that you will
58:44 recommend to the listeners. Is there
58:45 anything else that you would add to
58:47 that?
58:48 Um resources. Yeah. Uh for me I always
58:52 read a lot of technical stuff. So I for
58:55 like for example I spend every day
58:57 reading uh at least 30 minutes in
58:59 towards data science. It's very
59:01 [laughter]
59:02 uh tech but I I really love it. And on
59:05 books uh I can re recommend a book that
59:07 I just finished reading. It's called the
59:09 culture map. Um it's about how uh
59:12 different people uh from across the
59:14 world because we usually live in our
59:16 bubble. We know what is happening in in
59:18 our neighborhood. We know what is
59:20 happening in TV in media. But uh the
59:22 world is so much bigger and different
59:24 cultures. Uh you have to understand the
59:26 context uh how people think uh lead and
59:29 get things done. It's actually a really
59:31 good book called the culture map. Um,
59:33 and I am also uh currently in one of the
59:38 uh books that I'm uh reading is uh
59:40 called the seven habits of highly
59:41 effective people. I find it also very
59:43 interesting. Uh I do have a lot of
59:45 technical resources uh not just the uh
59:48 our resources let's say from analytics
59:50 for better world but others as well that
59:52 could be interesting. I will share this
59:54 across with you and maybe you can send
59:56 it to your uh subscribers. I think it
59:58 will be useful.
59:59 We will definitely include all the links
1:00:02 that all the resources that we talked
1:00:04 about in this uh interview and I think
1:00:07 there were quite a few of them in the
1:00:09 show notes in the description and yeah
1:00:12 with that I guess uh we don't we are a
1:00:15 bit over time so thanks a lot for
1:00:18 joining us today for sharing your
1:00:20 experience expertise with us. Thanks
1:00:22 everyone for joining us today for asking
1:00:24 questions and yeah it was fun. Thanks.
1:00:27 Thank you so much for the opportunity.
1:00:29 It was really good chatting with you as
1:00:30 well.
1:00:31 Yeah. And yeah, have a great weekend
1:00:34 everyone.
