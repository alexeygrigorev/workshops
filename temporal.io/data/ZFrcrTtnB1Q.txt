0:34 interview, you can ask any question you
0:36 want. Uh there is a pinned link in the
0:38 live chat. Click on that link, ask your
0:40 questions and I will we will be covering
0:42 these questions during the interview.
0:46 So that's the usual introduction. Um
0:50 I have the questions.
0:53 Um
0:55 and
0:58 I have um the questions on the left side
1:01 and zoom on the right side. So I'm ready
1:02 to start. Is if Sebastian you ready? We
1:05 can do it.
1:08 >> Yes.
1:10 >> So hi everyone. Uh this week we are
1:12 joined by Sebastian a bioinformatics
1:15 software engineer whose career bridges
1:17 biotechnology and programming. Sebastian
1:20 began in biotechnology engineering but
1:22 realized uh um just research wasn't his
1:25 path. Uh through a minor in software
1:28 engineering and master's degree
1:29 combining both fields he transitioned
1:31 into bioinformatics software
1:33 engineering. Um so we will I will ask
1:36 you more about these things and I'm
1:38 really happy to have you here on this
1:39 podcast.
1:42 >> Thank you very much.
1:44 >> Yeah. Uh yeah. So let's start the
1:47 question. Um the usually the first
1:49 question I always ask is to tell us more
1:52 about your career journey so far. I
1:54 outlined it briefly um to me I don't
1:58 know anything about biotechnology and
2:00 bio bio informatics except maybe one
2:02 course that I took on Corsera like 12
2:04 years ago but anyways so tell us about
2:07 your career journey so far.
2:09 >> Yes. So yeah I did my bachelor's here in
2:13 Ecuador. So I studied biotechnology
2:16 engineering which basically is the
2:19 application of living organisms to
2:22 different
2:24 in different areas. So you can apply it
2:26 to kind of develop new potential drugs
2:30 or to kind of in agriculture
2:34 and all of the applications are based on
2:37 living organisms. it can be in in
2:40 different parts and
2:43 then while I was doing my bachelors I
2:47 realized that I didn't like that much
2:49 that and the wet lab and biology and
2:52 this stuff so I started to take some
2:55 electives on programming and maths and I
2:59 kind of I like that more that approach
3:02 so I kind of did a minor in software
3:04 engineering
3:06 yeah and then in my masters I combine
3:08 both in binformatics and during the last
3:10 year I've been working more on software
3:12 development for the bionirmatics.
3:17 >> And you said you just finished your
3:19 project which was in Denmark and you
3:20 moved to Ecuador to spend the winter
3:22 there. Amazing idea. Yeah. So I live in
3:25 Berlin. So I can imagine what it is like
3:29 now in Denmark. Uh so I think it's even
3:33 worse than in Berlin cuz it's like by
3:34 the sea, closer to the sea. So yeah,
3:37 good idea spending time in Ecuador. Um
3:39 but um what exactly was your project
3:41 about? I don't know to what extent you
3:43 can talk about this, but was it pure
3:45 software engineering? Was it
3:46 bioinformatics? What do you actually do
3:49 now?
3:50 >> Yeah. Uh during the the last projects
3:53 that I worked during the la basically is
3:56 like I first I did my masters in the
3:59 Netherlands. I forgot to mention that in
4:01 bionopromatics and I did my master
4:03 thesis abroad like with my supervisor in
4:06 Denmark at
4:09 the technical university of Denmark and
4:14 during my master thesis I work in a
4:17 project that we call MCW2 graph. So
4:20 basically this is a knowledge graph to
4:22 investigate the wastewater treatment
4:24 microbiome. So basically a microbiome is
4:28 kind of the kind of all of the
4:31 microorganisms that live in a specific
4:33 environment. So what we did is like
4:37 usually like people take samples from
4:40 different environments in this case
4:43 wastewater treatment plants and then
4:46 they take samples and then they sequence
4:48 all of the kind the DNA or the proteins
4:51 that are inside this environment. And
4:53 then when you kind of process this data
4:56 you can see like the presence of
4:59 different the presence and abundance of
5:01 microorganisms in these samples. So what
5:04 we did is that we took kind of studies
5:07 from different kind of regions around
5:11 the world, different wastewater
5:12 treatments all over the world and then
5:14 we combine this data and then we imper
5:17 kind of these microbial association
5:19 networks we call. So it's like
5:22 correlation networks based on abundance
5:25 patterns. So based on co-abundance let's
5:28 say that we find a microorganism in this
5:31 sample and the same like another
5:34 microorganisms is also present in this
5:36 sample with a similar abundance. So we
5:39 kind of we infer that they are kind of
5:43 interacting somehow. So we created this
5:47 kind of networks and then we build a
5:49 knowledge gra on top of that with
5:51 additional metadata.
5:53 Yeah, that was my first project there
5:56 and then I work on others.
5:59 >> Yeah, I'm taking notes so I can ask you
6:02 later about these things. But uh for me
6:04 I know nothing about biotechnology.
6:07 >> Mhm. Um so when COVID happened right and
6:12 everyone was uh freaking out and then
6:14 people companies started to develop
6:16 vaccines. So do people like is
6:20 biotechnology involved there for
6:24 >> like how exactly does it work? Yeah,
6:27 actually it's like um so because you do
6:31 the experiments on on the lab to test
6:35 like the different
6:37 vaccines and how different compounds
6:40 kind of
6:42 can kill or combat the bacteria or the
6:45 viruses and you do that in the in the
6:50 lab. and and that is kind of
6:52 biotechnology and you design different
6:54 like components that are more efficient
6:56 to combat the viruses and and bacteria
6:58 and then bionirmatics
7:01 enters
7:03 here like to kind of reduce the amount
7:06 of experiments that you need to do on
7:08 the web lab. So you can do some
7:10 simulations or you can analyze the the
7:13 data to kind of propose potential
7:15 candidates that the people on the web
7:18 can test. So you reduce the time and you
7:22 propose some potential candidates that
7:24 in the end like the wet lab people test.
7:28 >> Yeah. I see. I think you have a slight
7:30 problem with um sound. Uh are you do you
7:34 use your uh headphones microphone?
7:38 >> Yeah. Uh I can
7:39 >> you can switch to
7:43 Can you try now?
7:46 I cannot hear you.
7:50 I'm sorry everyone. Um, but yeah, just
7:52 the sound is breaking a little.
7:58 Sorry. Now I switch to the my
8:03 laptop. Uh,
8:04 >> I think it's better. Yeah, cuz like the
8:06 the the sound was breaking a little like
8:09 every 3 seconds. That's why I thought
8:11 maybe it's like Bluetooth artifact.
8:14 >> Okay. Yeah, let's try. I think it's
8:16 better. So you were saying that um this
8:20 is what biotechnology
8:23 uh people who work in biotechnology this
8:25 is what they do especially when it comes
8:26 to like um these viruses and bacteria.
8:29 So you have a lab and in the lab uh you
8:33 have these experiments in the lab. So
8:35 you have bacteria or viruses and then
8:39 you make different experiments to see
8:41 what actually kills what helps to combat
8:44 these things. Right? So that's
8:45 >> that's what what biotechnologists do,
8:47 right? So they work in companies like
8:50 Fizer or other pharmaceutical companies,
8:53 right? And then they make these
8:55 experiments.
8:56 >> Mhm. Yes.
8:57 >> Yeah. Why is it called vet lab? Like is
9:00 it wet there in the lab?
9:02 >> Yeah. because it's kind of to make this
9:04 distinction between
9:06 dry lab which is more computational and
9:09 you don't kind of get your hands kind of
9:12 wet in a way and then yeah the other way
9:15 you need to do the actual experiments.
9:17 So yeah you have this distinction with
9:19 wet lab and dry lab. M so dry lab is you
9:24 sit in front of a computer but lab you
9:26 actually do all you know how all this um
9:30 like if you ask um to generate an image
9:33 of a person trying to develop a vaccine
9:35 I imagine they are like you know in
9:37 white clothes with glasses like holding
9:41 this uh you know how they call like
9:43 small bottles
9:44 >> tubes exactly like doing these things
9:47 and then there are like charts behind
9:49 their backs
9:51 Yeah.
9:53 >> Okay. You didn't enjoy this part, right?
9:55 Working in the lab.
9:57 >> Yes. No. No. Yeah. It's like um Yeah. I
10:00 didn't like it that much and and also in
10:03 my bachelor's kind of this this
10:04 biological courses I didn't like that
10:06 much the approach. It was much kind of
10:09 too theoretical and they have this kind
10:12 of learning by heart approach. So yeah
10:16 like um yeah in the middle of of my
10:19 bachelors I was like I don't like this
10:20 that much let's try that something else
10:23 and yeah I took like some programming
10:26 and math courses and yeah I realized
10:28 that the approach is a bit different
10:30 there is more practical so yeah I
10:32 remember that in the first programming
10:34 course that I took is like the first
10:36 maybe the f just the first course the
10:39 first class was theoretical and the rest
10:41 was just doing exercises just hands-on
10:43 on on the computer. So, I don't know. I
10:46 like it that a bit more.
10:48 >> Okay. Okay. And uh in the Netherlands,
10:51 where do you study? In which university?
10:53 >> In Mastri. Mastrict University.
10:56 >> Mastrict.
10:58 >> I don't know about this one. I
10:59 >> actually is in the borderline with
11:01 Belgium and Germany. Yeah. Just next to
11:04 Aken.
11:06 >> Okay. Okay.
11:07 >> Mhm.
11:08 >> Yeah. I I didn't know this thing existed
11:11 but so you worked uh you studied there
11:14 and then as a part of um your studies
11:17 you went to Denmark to work on projects
11:21 >> yes yes
11:22 >> okay okay and what is so we talked about
11:25 biotechnology biotechnology engineering
11:28 so this is uh I guess it's just only one
11:31 application but these are the people who
11:33 develop drugs these are the people who
11:34 develop vaccines right so that's
11:36 biotechnology
11:38 What is bioinformatics like how is it
11:40 different?
11:42 >> Yes, bioinformatics um yeah I would say
11:45 that I can I usually like define it as
11:49 data science applied to biology. So it's
11:52 like yeah just the domain of application
11:55 of data science is biology. So we just
11:59 um take the information that is
12:01 generated in the lab and then we do all
12:05 of the kind of typical data science
12:08 process like the data exploration,
12:10 exploratory analysis and then
12:13 interpretation of the results and then
12:15 we create some models to kind of predict
12:17 some stuff. So yeah I would define it
12:20 like that.
12:21 So basically you
12:24 do data science too but the
12:26 biotechnology is an old field and data
12:27 science is like I don't know 15 years
12:30 old.
12:30 >> Yeah that's true.
12:32 >> Okay. So um but what kind of data you
12:35 have? I remember so I mentioned at the
12:37 beginning that at some point of time I
12:40 took a course about bioinformatics. I
12:44 think we used R back then
12:46 >> and um I don't remember much except like
12:49 all the data we the data we were working
12:51 in they consisted of four different
12:53 letters.
12:54 >> Mhm.
12:54 >> Right.
12:55 >> Yes.
12:56 >> Um so what are these letters? Uh exactly
12:59 >> these are the basically the nucleotides.
13:01 So basically you can have
13:04 >> the nucleotides is like the the if you
13:08 have kind of genomics data is DNA. So
13:10 the DNA is composed of different kind of
13:14 chemical compounds that we call
13:16 nucleotides. These are like four
13:19 adinine, wenosine, cytosine and
13:24 yeah the other one but yeah just these
13:27 four letters that kind of are inside the
13:30 nucle nucleus or olive cells and they
13:34 kind of contain the genetic information
13:37 that kind of make all the proteins that
13:40 kind of yeah deliver all the functions
13:44 in our systems. Mhm. Okay. So, um yeah,
13:49 to me like still I'm very far from
13:51 there, but I remember that it was like
13:53 mostly strings of text with these four
13:56 letters.
13:57 >> Um so, you mentioned that in one of the
14:01 projects that you did or was one of the
14:03 last or maybe one of the projects you
14:05 did, you needed to sequence DNA and
14:07 proteins.
14:08 >> Mhm.
14:09 >> I have no idea what it means. Like, what
14:11 does it mean to sequence it? like aren't
14:13 they already in the sequence?
14:16 >> Yes, it's like we we call it sequence.
14:19 Basically, what what you do is like you
14:21 have like a sample. It it can be an
14:23 environmental sample or you it can be
14:25 like a blood kind of sample.
14:28 >> Okay. So, for example, I um a few years
14:30 ago, was it like four years ago, I did
14:34 uh there is a website called My
14:36 Heritage. It's ancestry.
14:39 Exactly. So I wanted to know where my
14:41 ancestors are coming from.
14:43 >> Mhm.
14:44 >> So what uh we did what they did they
14:47 sent um like a small thing that I needed
14:51 to put under my cheek and like um swap
14:53 there
14:54 >> under one and then the other side uh
14:57 under the other cheek. Then I put it in
14:59 the small tube and send it back. Right.
15:01 So that was the sample. Right. So they
15:03 took my saliva to analyze.
15:05 >> Mhm. And then after a few weeks they
15:07 said uh where my ancestors are coming
15:10 from. So it turned out that I'm 70% uh
15:14 um how do I say Baltics like from the
15:18 the Baltic countries
15:20 >> uh and then like I don't know 20% uh
15:23 Western European and then like the rest
15:25 is you know a mixture of everything.
15:28 >> So that was cool. Uh but I guess that's
15:30 uh one of the applications of
15:31 bioinformatics right?
15:33 >> Mhm. Yeah.
15:35 >> Yeah. So, so what happened like can you
15:37 walk us through? So, they took a sample
15:39 and what happens after the sample once
15:40 they receive it in the lab?
15:42 >> Yes. Then you you have this
15:46 these machines that can kind of analyze
15:50 the data. this kind of they call it the
15:52 sequencers where basically like um you
15:56 kind of extract the DNA in in the sample
16:00 and then you will kind of read it and
16:04 then you will decode it. So you will see
16:06 like what in what order of of kind of
16:11 nucleotides kind of your sample is in
16:14 and then like there are different steps.
16:18 So so
16:19 and there are there are different
16:21 technologies to do this but in the end
16:22 it's like you assemble everything. Yeah.
16:25 you you you kind of kind of break kind
16:28 of the the samples in in small pieces
16:32 and then you assemble everything and
16:34 then you kind of reconstruct the whole
16:36 genome. So the whole kind of your whole
16:40 DNA structure let's say and from that
16:45 it's like you can like there are some
16:47 databases where where uh you have
16:49 information about okay this specific
16:52 string of DNA corresponds to this gene
16:55 that and this gene can codify to this
16:58 specific protein that is involved in I
17:02 don't know in a disease or or also the
17:05 ancestry there are some biomarkers that
17:07 you can track that okay this biomarker
17:10 belongs to this kind of population here.
17:13 So yeah this is usually the approach
17:16 >> I think one I was 1% Irish or Welsh I
17:20 don't remember.
17:21 >> So I guess uh they saw like they take
17:24 the sequence they break it into chunks
17:25 and then one of the chunks corresponded
17:28 to people living in Ireland right?
17:30 >> Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.
17:32 >> Okay.
17:32 >> You can database
17:34 >> I see. Um so this is a a model right so
17:38 I don't know if it's machine learning
17:39 but some sort of data analytics uh model
17:42 right so you take a DNA you sequence you
17:45 chunk and then you look at the chunks
17:47 where
17:49 they belong to right so which
17:51 >> comparing to a reference genome
17:53 >> okay interesting uh I assume you didn't
17:56 do this you did something else right
17:58 >> yes you did
17:59 >> so what was the so now with when I
18:02 understand a little more about
18:03 biotechnology and bioinformatic Maybe
18:06 you can tell it one more time what you
18:09 were doing in that project was macra
18:12 >> beyond.
18:14 So yeah I don't even I can't even read
18:16 my handwritings about that.
18:20 >> Yes. Yes I can tell about that like yeah
18:22 that was my master thesis project. So
18:26 basically in in that case we took data
18:31 from
18:33 is what we call metagenomics which is
18:35 when you take s environmental samples
18:38 instead of let's say blood samples. So
18:41 you take environmental samples
18:43 >> samples are this like I don't know I go
18:45 to a lake and I take uh
18:48 >> a sample. Okay.
18:49 >> Mhm. Yeah. you you go to any kind of
18:51 environment you you you take um um I
18:54 don't know from the ground like like a
18:56 sample and then you can you can see like
18:58 what microorganisms are living there. So
19:01 it's basically you you decode the whole
19:05 DNA that is there and then you kind of
19:08 try to reconstruct like what genomes
19:11 from what microorganisms are in this
19:13 sample. So this is much more complex
19:15 than the just a blood sample that is
19:17 just one individual. In this case, you
19:20 are trying to kind of reconstruct the
19:22 the kind of genomes of the of all the
19:25 micro that live there.
19:27 >> So the goal of this step is so you take
19:29 a sample then you take um you need to
19:32 understand what kind of things are in
19:36 the sample, right? So what kind of
19:37 organisms microorganis?
19:41 >> Mhm. Yes. Mhm. So yeah and in this case
19:45 we focus on wastewater treatment plants.
19:49 So we wanted to kind of analyze this
19:52 data because in the database that we
19:55 that we took it was kind of the most
19:58 there were a lot of samples from there
20:00 and it was kind of there were kind of
20:03 samples from different places. So we
20:05 wanted to integrate all of this data
20:10 and so we basically download the and in
20:13 the end the what what you have is a
20:17 abundant an abundance table what we call
20:20 so in the rows you have kind of the
20:23 micronisms and in the columns you have
20:26 the samples so you have and you you have
20:28 counts so let's say that in sample one
20:31 you have I don't know five counts from
20:34 this micro organism. So this is the kind
20:38 of end result of this metagenomics and
20:40 this is the data that we have. So yeah,
20:44 we download this kind of abundance
20:46 tables from um different projects and
20:49 different studies and we kind of try to
20:52 kind of categorize them by different
20:55 kind of biomes
20:57 and then we infer these microbial
21:00 association networks. So is basically
21:04 based on correlations. So if you find
21:06 kind of co-abundance patterns between
21:10 different microorganisms, you can assume
21:12 that these micronisms are interacting
21:14 somehow.
21:16 And
21:16 >> what does it mean co-abundance patterns?
21:18 So this when you have this sample right
21:21 and you understand that you have like I
21:23 don't know three samples of three counts
21:26 from organism A five counts from
21:30 organism B and then there is in some
21:32 other sample you have kind of similar
21:34 thing right and then you
21:37 >> by analyzing all this um abundance
21:40 tables as you call them right
21:43 >> you can see that these coorganisms these
21:45 organisms tend to coexist Right. So you
21:49 you see them together often in the same
21:52 >> environments, right?
21:54 >> Mhm. Yeah.
21:55 >> Okay. Okay.
21:56 >> Yeah. That's basically it. And yeah, and
22:00 we kind of kind of create these links
22:02 between these microorganisms if they are
22:05 co-abundant.
22:08 >> Interesting. Uh so for me um I never
22:11 worked with this kind of data but what I
22:14 did is I did a bit of NLP and in NLP you
22:19 have this co occurrence tables. So you
22:22 uh when you have some context
22:25 and uh you see that certain words appear
22:27 together then you can say that they are
22:30 co how do you call them
22:34 >> occurring
22:35 >> couring yeah so there is a special term
22:37 for that I don't remember like New York
22:39 right so New York is always like that if
22:40 you see New York like it's very likely
22:44 that they coer right or um
22:48 not usually names of movies it's names
22:50 of movies uh but also some expressions
22:53 right so if you see one word and maybe
22:57 another one is very likely to happen
22:58 there or sometimes certain words just
23:01 follow each other right so like after a
23:04 verb uh make we have another I don't
23:07 know noun make noise right so maybe this
23:10 is how you use so this is what they do
23:12 in NLP and then they use I don't
23:16 remember it was so long ago but
23:17 basically there's simple there are
23:19 simple statistics you calculate um
23:23 I remember it involved al lo al lo al lo
23:25 al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al
23:25 lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo al lo
23:25 al lo al lo al lo al logarithms but
23:26 basically you do a statistical test like
23:28 how likely that these two things they're
23:31 just so common that they
23:34 um always you find them in sample or
23:36 it's actually stat statistic you have
23:38 statistically significant evidence that
23:41 they co occur right so then you perform
23:43 the statistical test and you can
23:45 conclude that this is a like biogram or
23:48 whatever right and the came with in the
23:50 commander systems. and recommend
23:51 systems. um I don't know um I buy um
24:00 phone and then I need a charger right
24:02 something like this I don't don't know
24:04 right now they don't sell chargers with
24:06 phones right but anyway so there there
24:07 are certain types of things that you
24:10 tend to buy together so then you can
24:12 also find this coccurrence patterns in
24:14 people's uh transactions right using a
24:17 very similar approach and then based on
24:19 that based on simple statistics you can
24:20 recommend actually these products
24:23 And what you do
24:25 looks very similar.
24:27 >> Mhm.
24:27 >> Right. What do you use there?
24:31 >> In that case is like we use um kind of
24:35 um a method based on actually it's
24:39 called CC lasso. So is based on yeah on
24:41 on the lasso algorithm to kind of
24:45 predict this yeah predict this kind of
24:50 potential interactions among the
24:51 micronisms. So we in the end we kind of
24:54 calculate this um correlation values
24:58 among every pair of micronisms.
25:02 Uh
25:03 >> so how does it work? Do you create like
25:05 a regression model? Yeah. with this um
25:10 interactions right between organis one
25:13 and organis B right and a regression
25:15 model and if the coefficient is not zero
25:17 then it means that this these things co
25:22 abundant right
25:23 >> yeah it's like we we we kind of we
25:26 obtain a value between minus one and one
25:30 and then if there is kind of we kind of
25:33 set a threshold um to kind of define
25:39 if the value keeps on the table or not
25:41 and then we can specify the table and
25:44 then
25:44 >> we kind of keep and then we have kind of
25:47 negative and positive correlations
25:50 >> we can
25:51 >> which can have kind of some biological
25:53 interpretation but you can be you should
25:55 be careful with that.
25:57 >> Mhm. What does the negative correlation
25:59 mean in this case?
26:01 >> Is that that that the the microorganisms
26:04 kind of when one microorganism is in is
26:07 in the sample the other is not there. So
26:09 maybe they are kind of releasing some
26:12 components that kind of kind of
26:15 >> I don't know one cannot live in the same
26:17 environment as the other.
26:18 >> I see. I see. Okay. So
26:21 >> yeah. Okay. Positive correlation means
26:23 they like to coexist together. Negative
26:26 correlation means that they don't exist
26:28 together. Right.
26:29 >> Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
26:31 >> But like could it be just geographic or
26:32 when you do this co-abundance pattern
26:35 extraction you restrict yourself to a
26:38 certain area. Let's say you take a lake
26:40 and then you just take all the samples
26:42 around this lake and then the lake and
26:43 then you do the analysis there. So these
26:45 things that are potentially that
26:46 potentially live together but in the
26:48 samples you don't see them. Right.
26:50 That's
26:50 >> Yeah, it can be.
26:52 >> Yeah.
26:52 >> Okay. That's interesting.
26:54 >> Mhm. So uh did you have experience in uh
26:58 working with like non bioinformatics
27:00 data
27:02 >> in like like before in general or
27:06 >> in general? Yeah.
27:08 >> Uh actually most of the projects that
27:11 I've been working on have been like in
27:13 biology.
27:16 Yeah. like different kind of types of
27:19 data like at some point that work on
27:22 more like kind of simulations of
27:24 proteins
27:26 and it's like in that case it's like you
27:29 have some kind of proteins like a
27:32 protein and a lian that you know that
27:34 they interact and then you run kind of
27:36 simulations like you you basically
27:39 simulate a water box and then you kind
27:42 of let the proteins move on simulation
27:47 and then you have some kind of
27:49 physicchemical kind of parameters and
27:51 then you measure it and then you can see
27:54 kind of if they interact or not
27:56 something like that but I did that like
27:58 when I was in my bachelors but yeah most
28:00 of the things are kind of biology
28:02 related
28:03 >> yeah the reason I'm asking about that is
28:06 cuz I was curious if you observed any
28:08 similar patterns like right now you were
28:10 talking about this co-abundance pattern
28:11 and I thought okay like this is very
28:13 similar to the thing I was doing before
28:15 like even though it was a while ago but
28:17 like
28:18 >> and I thought wow like it's um
28:21 >> now I understand a little bit about
28:23 bionformmatics cuz like my experience my
28:25 past experience from working on
28:27 something completely unrelated can
28:29 actually transfer to bioinformatics and
28:31 for me was like wow so cool and I was
28:34 thinking maybe like there are other
28:36 things like that
28:37 >> so that's why I asked you about your
28:39 experience with working other things cuz
28:41 uh I imagine maybe somebody's actually
28:44 >> listening here who has this. Uh I see
28:47 that there is a Mark who says um that
28:51 he's a microbiology student and the meal
28:53 engineer. Yeah. Hi Mark.
28:55 >> Um
28:57 anyways um so yeah I know we're kind of
29:03 uh like there are questions that we
29:04 prepared but I'm a bit sidelining
29:08 uh because I'm really interested in
29:09 these things like what you mentioned and
29:11 I'm curious to know more. So you were
29:15 talking about protein experiments
29:18 and simulation of proteins
29:21 >> and was it a few years ago when I think
29:24 it was Google they managed to use AI for
29:28 >> oh yeah
29:29 >> proteins
29:30 >> predict the kind of the structure from
29:32 the sequence kind of alpha fault maybe
29:34 >> alpha fault yeah and for me uh like
29:37 everyone was talking about this that
29:38 this is such a breakthrough
29:40 >> and nobody were able to do this before.
29:44 >> Mhm.
29:44 >> And for me I because my background in uh
29:47 this is very limited for me I did not
29:50 understand the significance of this.
29:52 >> Mhm.
29:53 >> Right. And now I get a chance to talk to
29:55 somebody who understand these things.
29:58 >> So I wonder maybe you can explain in
30:00 simple terms like what's the big deal of
30:02 this alpha fault like why do we care
30:05 >> about these things?
30:06 >> Yes. basically like in general kind of
30:09 proteins are really important because
30:11 they kind of they do all the functions
30:14 that living organisms
30:17 kind of do. So they are
30:20 so so for me I have like this mentality
30:22 of how you say a gym bro like proteins
30:24 are important because like after
30:26 training you need to consume proteins.
30:32 Right.
30:34 >> Yes. But
30:35 >> they are important on other levels too,
30:37 right? Not just for that.
30:39 >> Basically they they are like these small
30:41 molecules that do all of the kind of
30:44 jobs at small scales and big scales. So
30:48 yeah and um there were effort a lot of
30:52 kind of efforts to kind of
30:55 because the thing is that the first you
30:58 have the sequence the protein sequence
31:00 but then when the proteins kind of do
31:04 kind of the different jobs they kind of
31:06 fold in a in the 3D space and
31:13 the kind of
31:14 >> sequence is a a string right with all
31:16 these four nucleio how nucleotypes or
31:20 >> yeah like in proteins you have kind of
31:23 32 amino acids because it's not DNA
31:25 anymore so it's kind of
31:27 >> okay but you have a string right but
31:29 this string is already like I don't know
31:32 can you call it sequence or like we have
31:33 a string but when you put the string
31:36 into the real space in 3D they start
31:40 like uh folding
31:42 >> exactly
31:43 >> and the way they fold it could be the
31:46 same thing but uh if they fall
31:48 differently then they would serve
31:49 different functions right
31:51 >> mhm exactly
31:52 >> okay okay
31:54 >> yes and then it's like the the kind of
31:56 the search space there is huge I
31:59 remember that it was kind of more than
32:01 the the stars in the universe or
32:04 something like that so this kind of
32:06 transition from the sequence to the
32:08 structure is is really difficult to
32:10 predict and to kind of yeah the to see
32:15 And there were a lot of efforts like
32:17 from other like more traditional kind of
32:20 approaches to do this. And uh kind of
32:24 the the yeah there there was this
32:27 competition that is called CASP that
32:29 kind of evaluates this kind of they do
32:32 some task to some teams to kind of do
32:34 these predictions and yeah when Alpha
32:38 fall enter like Alpha Fall one they kind
32:41 of just did the predictions much better
32:46 better than the other teams and
32:50 and these kind of applications can kind
32:53 Like by knowing the structure of the
32:55 proteins from the sequence
32:58 you can because usually like to do this
33:01 uh to kind of the kind of know the
33:04 structure of the protein you do this in
33:06 in the wet lab and then you use this um
33:10 kind of crystalallography and X-ray
33:13 experiments and it's really really
33:15 difficult. I remember that I had a
33:17 friend that did this kind a PhD in this
33:20 field and the kind of knowing the
33:23 structure of one single protein was the
33:26 whole PhD project of of her. So it it's
33:30 really time consuming and kind of it can
33:32 take a lot of time and when Alphaold
33:35 kind of did this you can do it like in
33:38 seconds it's Yeah. It's it's crazy
33:42 >> instead of five years.
33:43 >> Exactly.
33:44 >> It is. Yeah, it's like
33:48 it depends on what type of protein like
33:50 in kind of single proteins with kind of
33:54 that are not in complexes or kind of
33:56 that yeah I don't remember like the
33:59 specificities but in certain cases like
34:01 like basically the basic ones it does a
34:04 good job like kind of I think that 90%
34:10 kind of confidence but when you have
34:12 more complicated structures it is not
34:15 that And you need kind of to validate
34:17 that with the experimental
34:19 >> one. What are the practical
34:21 implications? Can we do drug discovery
34:24 faster now or?
34:25 >> Yes. Yes. Yes, we can do uh drug
34:27 discovery and also kind of explore like
34:33 more kind of proteins applications in
34:36 different fields like agriculture and
34:39 kind of yeah other areas because you can
34:43 apply also these enzymes for instance in
34:45 industry like you can create an an
34:48 enzyme that do a specific process that
34:50 accelerated
34:51 >> like different things. So yeah
34:54 applications are kind of everywhere
34:56 >> and these proteins are important because
34:58 they are building blocks for many
35:00 organisms right.
35:01 >> Yes.
35:02 >> This is the reason like I was talking
35:03 about this example like you go to gym
35:05 and then you need to consume certain
35:06 amount of proteins. This is important
35:08 because you want to build your muscles
35:10 and this is the building blocks, right?
35:13 So these proteins that uh people consume
35:16 that I consume they can they go to
35:19 certain parts of your body and then they
35:21 uh I don't know the body kind of
35:23 deconstructs them and then they can fold
35:24 in certain structures or what exactly is
35:27 happening?
35:28 >> Yes, it's like the there are the thing
35:31 is that there are also different types
35:32 of proteins. There are one of these that
35:34 kind of assemble together to create the
35:36 kind of more complicated structures but
35:38 also there are the ones that kind of do
35:41 other functions like the hemoglobin for
35:43 instance they kind of carry oxygen like
35:47 in the body and yeah in
35:51 >> every function that the living organisms
35:53 does like there is a protein involved.
35:55 So that's why they are really important.
35:58 >> Mhm. And we living we the living
36:00 organisms we consume these proteins and
36:03 the body uses the parts of the protein
36:06 for its purposes right.
36:07 >> Mhm.
36:08 >> I see. Interesting. Um yeah I mean I
36:13 cannot
36:14 say with confidence I understood
36:16 everything but at least it's a little
36:17 bit more clearer right now. Thank you.
36:20 >> You worked on quite a few projects. Look
36:22 at the document like the projects um
36:26 Mike V2 graph view gen view core um
36:32 >> what are these projects and uh can you
36:34 tell us more about these projects what
36:35 do they do?
36:36 >> Yes I already mentioned this MCW2 graph
36:40 who was the kind of knowledge graph with
36:43 the microorganisms and
36:45 >> yeah last year I was
36:47 >> we talked about this core abundance
36:49 patterns right?
36:50 >> Yes. So once you extract the patterns
36:52 you can put them in a graph right. So
36:54 these these nodes have positive
36:56 coefficients. These nodes have negative
36:58 coefficients. Right. And then not nodes
37:00 but vertices sorry the edges.
37:03 >> Uh right. Okay. So graph.
37:06 >> Mhm. And then every node is a
37:08 microorganisms and you have an edge if
37:10 there is like a cobundance patterns
37:13 among them. And then what we did is that
37:15 we created these kind of graphs and then
37:18 we enrich that with some metadata. let's
37:20 say some that we know that a mic
37:22 organisms release a specific metabolite
37:25 or that a microorganisms is living in a
37:27 specific biome. So we kind of added that
37:31 information and we build this knowledge
37:33 graph.
37:34 Yeah. And then we applied some
37:36 clustering
37:37 kind of algorithms to kind of find some
37:42 microbial communities that are involved
37:44 in a specific pathways or biological
37:46 processes that can be important in the
37:49 in this case kind of wastewater
37:51 treatment but this can be applied to
37:53 kind of other fields.
37:55 Mhm. So I just Googled this uh Mike W2
37:58 graph and I see um article
38:03 um Mike W2 graph building a knowledge
38:07 graph of the wastewater treatment
38:10 microbiome and its biological context
38:14 um MAC SBO science days 2024 and you are
38:18 the author.
38:19 >> Ah okay
38:21 >> that's cool. So um yeah it describes
38:24 that it's open source knowledge graph.
38:26 Um that's very interesting. Um so how
38:29 can people use it now?
38:31 >> Yeah we created a stream web application
38:34 with a summary of uh we had some tabs
38:37 for the exploratory data analysis and
38:40 also like the microbial association
38:42 networks for every biome and then from
38:44 the knowledge graph. So uh people can
38:46 download the dump file of it and you can
38:49 open it in a Neo4ja as a Neo4j instance.
38:53 >> Um but you can access you also have
38:56 access to the row kind of CSV file of of
39:01 this knowledge wrap but you can also
39:03 visual visualize it on the on the web
39:06 application.
39:07 >> And uh when I have this uh Neo forj
39:10 database what can I do with this?
39:13 um you can uh run some kind of graph
39:17 algorithms some clustering let's say or
39:20 some centrality analysis and uh yeah you
39:23 have kind of the as I mentioned kind of
39:25 the experimental
39:27 edges that we infer
39:30 and then you have the also the extra
39:33 metadata
39:35 where you can analy you mean like
39:37 something you did not observe in
39:40 practice but given the structure of the
39:42 graph
39:42 You assume that uh these two organisms
39:46 they probably co
39:48 they probably have coalance patterns
39:50 too, right?
39:51 >> Mhm.
39:52 >> Oh, that's cool. That's really
39:53 interesting.
39:54 >> And the other two project um uh this
39:58 view gen and view core.
40:00 >> Mhm. That that's what I was working like
40:02 in the last year like after my masters.
40:06 So injen basically is a python package
40:09 that automates the creation of
40:11 scientific reports. So the idea is that
40:14 um you can provide reports by just
40:18 providing a directory with a kind of um
40:21 a specific structure and then you have
40:24 some tables kind of plots in different
40:27 like it can be a static or interactive
40:29 plots network and file or HTML files and
40:34 then with one single command you can
40:35 generate kind of documents like PDF,
40:38 HTML, DOX, presentations
40:41 or extreme with web applications. So the
40:43 idea is to kind of make it easier to
40:46 create these kind of reports.
40:48 >> Yeah, I just shared the link to this uh
40:51 mic W2 graph and to Eugen to in the
40:53 chat.
40:54 >> I also put this in the description. So
40:56 for people it only has 28 stars. Uh let
41:00 me just increase this number.
41:03 >> Thank you.
41:04 >> Everyone who is watching, please do the
41:06 same. Um,
41:08 okay. I I think I need to Okay, now here
41:11 you go. You have a star. Um, so what do
41:14 you use inside like do you just parse
41:16 the data or you do some intelligent
41:18 parsing with an LLM or what is actually
41:21 happening?
41:22 >> Right now under the hood we are using
41:25 quto for the quarto and stream lead. So
41:30 um this is kind of kind of traditional
41:34 kind of yeah object oriented
41:38 programming. We haven't added kind of
41:41 the LLM or kind of to interpret kind of
41:44 the information yet. But that is kind of
41:46 project that we have in the future. But
41:49 um basically we interpret kind of this
41:52 um struct the kind of directory
41:54 structure and then we create this kind
41:56 of YAML file with the information
42:00 with the path information and the
42:02 descriptions and everything and then um
42:05 yeah we just generate this uh kind of
42:10 for streaml apps we generate the Python
42:12 scripts for every kind of tab and for
42:15 the web application and for quto we
42:17 create this markdown this QMD file which
42:21 is kind of basically markdown file that
42:24 quartto can render and then you can kind
42:26 of produce a PDF but x ppdx for kind of
42:29 other formats.
42:30 >> Yeah, I see it links um dependencies.
42:35 Vue genen uses quatro to generate
42:37 various report types and then when I
42:38 click I can learn. I had no idea this
42:41 library existed and then also I noticed
42:43 that vue genen is also available on
42:45 bioonda. What is bioonda? Yes, bioaconda
42:48 is basically a branch of cond which
42:51 which has kind of yeah packages related
42:55 to biology, bionformatics by engineering
42:58 and stuff like that.
43:02 >> Are there many libraries in bioond
43:06 [Music]
43:07 >> 11,733?
43:10 That's that's a lot.
43:12 >> Yeah. Yeah.
43:13 >> Are there many biological packages? Oh
43:17 >> yeah. Yeah, there is
43:19 >> like it's um like I opened the first
43:21 page and it's it has 470 pages.
43:25 >> Okay. Like people have been busy
43:27 creating bioological packages for
43:31 Anaconda. It seems
43:33 >> it went completely uh like I had no
43:38 knowledge about this whatsoever. It's
43:40 interesting. Okay. So now somebody so
43:44 I'm thinking of like direct application
43:46 somebody is working in the lab is doing
43:48 experiments and with this tool they can
43:50 just say okay my experiments are in this
43:52 folder uh go generate a report and then
43:54 it generates a report and now you can
43:56 they can publish this report uh in
43:58 whatever format could be streaml could
44:01 be jupyter notebook could be pdf file
44:03 right
44:03 >> mhm yes
44:05 >> that's nice and the other view was it
44:08 vor
44:09 >> yes viewor yeah with viewor the idea is
44:11 to kind of ease the generation of
44:15 interactive and static visualization
44:17 from OMIX data
44:20 and omix data is kind of genomics. Yeah,
44:24 we called like omix to kind of all of
44:27 this as I explained kind of
44:29 >> genomics
44:31 >> genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and
44:34 >> yeah proteomics is with proteins
44:36 >> only your genomics.
44:38 >> Uhhuh. Proteinomics.
44:41 >> Proteomics.
44:42 >> Proteomics. Okay. Wow.
44:43 >> Yeah. Basically take a samples and then
44:45 you can see the what are the peptides
44:49 and kind of proteins that are in this
44:51 sample
44:54 >> and then you you have different layers.
44:56 So right now what people is doing is
44:59 trying to integrate these different
45:01 layers to understand to have a kind of
45:03 holistic view of kind of a living
45:06 system.
45:08 >> Okay. Interesting. I see that we have uh
45:11 a few questions. I don't know should we
45:13 maybe cover them before we run out of
45:16 time.
45:17 >> So uh Yakatarina is asking which
45:20 beginner friendly bionformatic projects
45:22 uh um would best show showcase my skills
45:28 to future employers. So like if I want
45:30 to uh work in the bioinformatics areas
45:35 area what kind of projects do I need to
45:38 do to showcase it to have in my
45:40 portfolio?
45:42 >> Yes. It's like I think that um what I
45:47 what I did when I was in in my bachelor
45:50 is like I just um
45:53 find a topic that uh that I like and
45:57 then I started to play with this kind of
45:59 packages for instance in bioonda there
46:01 are some that you can parse these
46:03 strings and stuff like that and then um
46:07 I I think that right now is kind of easy
46:11 just to test these packages and in a
46:14 specific application domain that you
46:16 like you can choose this and then kind
46:21 of I don't know create a stream web
46:23 application a simple one like just to
46:25 showcase like what the tool is doing but
46:28 I remember that when I was in my
46:30 bachelor like it was like biologist
46:34 are kind of historically let's say maybe
46:36 now like most of the people kind of have
46:38 an intuition of programming computers
46:40 and stuff but when I I was working on
46:42 this. People were doing this everything
46:45 manually and simple things like uh like
46:48 just creating a batch script to just
46:50 parsing files and data was a huge
46:53 improvement because something that
46:55 people used to do like from graphical
46:58 user interface you can do in the common
47:00 line in I don't know one minute instead
47:03 of one hour of working. So yeah, I
47:05 remember that this specific tasks in the
47:09 command line
47:11 I really like it like when I discover it
47:13 like just playing with the command line
47:15 with I don't know commands like rep cut
47:18 and stuff like this help a lot but then
47:20 a bigger project uh you can explore this
47:23 kind of bioond or also in R there is a I
47:26 think that in bionformatics like the big
47:28 bigger communities still in R this there
47:31 is this bioonductor
47:33 kind of uh framework where a lot of
47:36 people publish binformatics tools and I
47:40 would say that you can find data sets
47:44 um there and then you can just try it uh
47:47 try the tools and then showcase some
47:50 exploratory analysis and stuff like
47:53 that.
47:54 >> Do you use AI LMS and this kind of stuff
47:57 in your uh work these days?
48:01 things can like for me as a developer AI
48:04 helps tremendously bying something so I
48:08 assume it's probably similar in
48:09 bioinformatics too right
48:11 >> yeah it is it is yeah LLM and this
48:15 generative AI is also really prevalent
48:19 and important right now in this field
48:22 yeah a lot of people is working on tools
48:25 to improve this
48:27 and I I personally also
48:29 use it a lot like to brainstorm ideas or
48:33 like also to help with documentation.
48:37 And yeah, in my in the projects that I
48:41 was working on, we also wanted to
48:43 implement this kind of MCPS protocols
48:48 just to try it out and see how they
48:50 work.
48:52 >> That's interesting. Okay, that's
48:54 amazing. Um another question which
48:57 online resources, tutorials or courses
48:59 would you recommend for biochemistry
49:01 gradiates interested in biotech and
49:03 informatics?
49:04 Biochemistry is uh is it I guess from
49:09 the name I assume that's inter something
49:12 intersection between biology and
49:14 chemistry right?
49:15 >> Mhm.
49:17 >> Yeah.
49:17 >> Yes. I would say that um right now I I
49:22 don't I don't remember any specific
49:24 resource
49:27 but I think that let me check something
49:33 [Music]
49:35 because I yeah I remember that I had
49:38 some a list of courses that I think that
49:42 there is one this I was I was on
49:45 bionformatics or something like that on
49:47 GitHub. So maybe I think that that can
49:50 be
49:51 >> amazing by Informatics.
49:52 >> Yeah, amazing. Yeah, amazing
49:53 bionformmatics.
49:57 >> Yeah, I see this curated list of uh uh
50:02 awesome bionformatics.
50:04 >> Yeah, awesome binatics.
50:06 >> Exactly.
50:06 >> 3.7,000
50:08 stars. Okay, I'm going to share it. But
50:11 yeah, it's actually very easy to find it
50:13 if you just Google it. Uh multiple
50:15 people just uh gave a star to your repo.
50:18 So thanks very much.
50:18 >> Oh, thank you very much.
50:20 >> And Mark says um he uses bioonda.
50:25 So yeah, apparently it's a thing. I just
50:28 didn't know about this.
50:30 >> So it's um so in Rh
50:35 bioonductor, right? So the
50:38 >> and bioond is similar but in Python,
50:40 right?
50:41 Yeah, but in in R, I think that the
50:45 community is bigger in R now.
50:47 >> Yeah,
50:48 >> that people is transitioning a bit to
50:49 Python, but right now I would say that
50:52 most of the packages are still being
50:54 published in R.
50:57 >> Yeah. And the problem is like sometimes
51:00 these packages are develop are being
51:02 developed by byformaticians which were
51:04 not trained like as a software
51:06 developers. So when you want to scale
51:08 these kind of tools sometimes you find
51:12 you find issues there.
51:14 >> Mhm. And uh you need to scale because
51:17 right now you work with uh big amounts
51:20 of data right
51:21 >> so you need to process a lot of data and
51:23 then these libraries what do you do like
51:25 do you rewrite these libraries in Python
51:27 or what do you do in this case when they
51:29 are not scalable?
51:31 >> Um
51:33 in yeah in this case yeah it's a bit
51:35 complicated. Sometimes you need to kind
51:37 of
51:39 yeah kind of expand it in on source code
51:41 or ask to the developers like like I
51:43 have this use case like what can I do
51:46 >> like to
51:47 >> kind of go beyond this. Yeah. But it's a
51:50 bit tricky. Yeah.
51:53 >> So I wonder if LMS can help with that.
51:56 probably because like with all these uh
51:59 agents coding agents like you can so
52:01 easily translate from one language to
52:03 another
52:04 >> plus bugs and stuff
52:06 >> like for example I can take a project
52:08 that doesn't have any tests and then I
52:10 can just ask a cloud code like hey can
52:13 you please cover it with tests right
52:16 >> and then it will try to understand what
52:17 this project is about and then create
52:19 test for that so that's really cool
52:22 >> yeah what are you working on right
52:26 Uh yeah, right now like uh my last
52:30 project was this Buor like I was kind of
52:33 finishing it. So yeah, the idea is to
52:36 >> yeah bu is kind of we try to kind of
52:42 cover like different kind of plotting
52:44 libraries
52:46 and then um
52:50 >> sorry
52:51 >> I found a website called bioore nl but I
52:54 think it's
52:55 >> no no sorry it's bor
52:58 but how do you write it b
53:02 Yeah.
53:04 >> B U O
53:05 >> U B U E E
53:07 >> B U E E. Okay.
53:12 >> Okay.
53:15 >> So, yeah, that one is more kind of
53:17 >> you. Okay.
53:18 >> Uh-huh.
53:19 >> Yeah. The one we talked about, right?
53:21 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
53:22 >> Sorry, I misunderstood.
53:25 Um like I didn't hear you pronouncing
53:28 correctly. Yeah. You we talked about
53:30 this. Uhhuh.
53:33 Yeah.
53:35 >> Yeah. And then the idea is to
53:36 >> Yeah. You're chilling in Ecuador.
53:39 >> Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That was the last
53:41 one that I work and now I am in in a
53:43 break here in Ecuador trying to can
53:46 enjoy the mountains. I am really into
53:48 this kind of hiking maing and stuff like
53:51 that. So yeah, in Denmark I didn't have
53:53 any. So here
53:55 >> are there are many parrots.
53:58 >> Many what?
53:59 >> Parrots. The birds. birds. Yeah. Yeah.
54:02 Yeah. A lot like for bird watching is
54:04 amazing here. Like
54:06 >> also in the jungle in the Amazon. Wow.
54:10 >> Yeah. Must be amazing. Okay. I actually
54:13 need to like I have another thing
54:15 starting soon so I need to go now. Uh
54:18 Sebastian thanks a lot. It was really
54:20 nice talking to you. So for me I learned
54:22 uh many new things. I kind of suspected
54:25 that proteins are important
54:27 um not just you know for consuming whey
54:30 protein after a gym but like for other
54:32 purposes. So thanks a lot and for this
54:34 ad for like I also I I everyone was
54:37 talking about this on social media and
54:39 I'm like okay what's the what's the deal
54:41 with this so thanks a lot for joining us
54:44 for telling us about that. Uh so for me
54:46 the aha moment was that okay I actually
54:49 with my knowledge I can do some things
54:51 because I can relate my previous
54:53 experience to what you did. So that was
54:55 also pretty interesting. So thanks a lot
54:57 for joining us and thanks everyone also
54:59 for joining us uh asking questions
55:01 giving the star if somebody doesn't
55:03 hasn't give the star yet to this uh
55:06 project and give and then maybe you can
55:08 also find this view core right and then
55:11 start it too because it's also open
55:12 source correct
55:13 >> yes is also yeah
55:14 >> so please give a start to that too okay
55:19 that's it for today thank you
55:21 >> thank you very much Alex I have a lot of
55:24 fun Yeah.
