0:43 that link, ask your questions, and we
0:45 will be covering these questions during
0:47 the interview. And I think this is an
0:50 icon from Grammarly, but I stopped using
0:52 it very long ago. Um there's actually a
0:55 meetup in Berlin from Grammarly how they
0:57 use LLMs. So probably is interesting. Uh
1:02 to me I stopped using Grammarly because
1:03 of LLMs.
1:05 So
1:07 >> Mhm.
1:07 >> Uh yeah I'm curious how they are doing.
1:10 So anyways um
1:13 now the intro is done. Um I have the
1:16 file with questions open in front of me.
1:20 And now if you're ready we can start.
1:23 Yes.
1:25 >> Okay. Um, you know, by the way, you have
1:27 very nice earrings.
1:29 >> Thank you.
1:30 >> Right. [laughter]
1:31 Very cute.
1:32 >> Yeah.
1:33 >> Okay. Um, so this week we'll talk about
1:36 career transitions, leadership, and
1:38 building inclusive data teams. We have a
1:40 very special guest today. Shia Sha Shai
1:42 is the head of data and cloud at N.
1:48 [laughter]
1:48 >> So it's written now and it's very hard
1:50 to pronounce it not as now. N O or it's
1:53 NOV. How do you pronounce it?
1:55 >> No or N.
1:57 >> No. Cuz it's a German company. So it's
1:59 NOV. Uh where supports Germanists
2:03 transition towards zero emission
2:05 mobility through data and cloud
2:06 innovation. That sounds really
2:08 interesting. So I hope we'll talk a bit
2:10 about that. Her journey from being a
2:12 full-time mom to leading a data team is
2:15 a story of resilience, growth, and
2:16 inclusion. Welcome to our event. I'm
2:19 really uh happy to have you here.
2:22 >> Thank you, Alex, to have you. [laughter]
2:25 >> Yeah. And we've been in touch many times
2:27 before that. Uh I know you've been uh
2:29 you were a student of you were taking
2:32 part in some of our courses. So we
2:34 interacted before recently we had a
2:36 lunch. So for me it's very pleasant to
2:38 have you here to interview you. And I
2:40 want to start with the interview uh from
2:42 the question I ask everyone is um I want
2:47 to start with your background. Can you
2:48 tell us about your career journey so
2:50 far?
2:51 >> Yeah, sure. I can share uh very shortly
2:54 of my background. Um actually um I
2:58 studied automotive engineering in China,
3:02 Italy and France. Um moving to Germany
3:05 was actually never part of the plan. I I
3:09 could have the chance to study in Tu
3:12 Munchin, but I said, "Oh, it was too
3:14 cold. [laughter] I I don't want to go
3:16 there." [gasps] But
3:17 >> but France is cold too, right?
3:20 >> No, no. France
3:21 >> or was it south of France? Because Paris
3:23 is like very similar to Berlin. No.
3:26 >> Yeah. I I studied in Liam. So it was
3:29 very nice city
3:31 >> and then I because my husband [laughter]
3:34 come to Berlin moved to Berlin
3:36 >> and it was for me very difficult to find
3:39 a good job in automotive uh industry
3:42 because most of uh in the south of uh
3:45 Germany and then then I get married and
3:49 get two children. [gasps and laughter]
3:51 So actually I stayed yeah I spent four
3:54 or five years uh at home.
3:58 Um in between I I tried one job what
4:02 which was uh not relevant to what I
4:05 studied. I say I want to go out. Um and
4:09 then uh in 2018 so the transition that
4:13 yeah I want to yeah study data science
4:17 and become a data scientist. That was
4:19 the goal at that time and um then yeah
4:25 after I studied a second master of data
4:28 science in heart TV and Berlin and then
4:33 um I changed um frequently jobs
4:37 [laughter] so almost every year one job
4:40 and then until I'm was I'm very happy to
4:44 be here uh in my current company anov
4:47 beha uh which I found the job also very
4:50 meaningful and the company culture
4:54 extremely good and I was very mot and
4:57 still very yeah I'm very motivated
5:00 and yeah that's uh how I get also pro
5:04 promoted um in very short short time.
5:08 >> So you've been uh doing data science uh
5:11 since 2018 right so for roughly
5:15 >> was it like seven years now right?
5:17 >> Mhm. Yeah. Okay. That's that's already
5:21 quite a lot of time, right? So, it was
5:23 before all this AI stuff where do you
5:26 remember these times where we had to do
5:27 all these things by hand? Crazy.
5:30 >> Yes. [laughter]
5:32 [clears throat]
5:33 >> Yeah. Was it difficult um like for you
5:37 with two children uh with a completely
5:40 different background to go basically you
5:42 needed to start from scratch, right?
5:45 >> Mhm. So tell us more like what did you
5:47 do for that? What did you study? You you
5:49 said you did a masters. Um but I imagine
5:53 it's not also super easy. So tell us
5:55 more about that.
5:57 >> Yeah. So the transition the turning
5:59 point like okay um that I want to go
6:03 back uh to university to study was
6:06 actually very uh run uh accident. I
6:11 received um a call from a head hunter, a
6:15 British woman on the other side asked me
6:18 about Yeah. Um
6:21 um could you like do you know machine
6:23 learning? They're looking for someone
6:25 with a mechanical engineering background
6:27 like and for startup doing the robotics.
6:32 There was first time I hear about what
6:34 is machine learning, what is data
6:36 science and reinforcement learning. So I
6:40 was like wow because I I was so I spend
6:44 so much time with the kids with the
6:45 children and I think my my connection
6:49 all moms from the kindergarten [gasps] I
6:51 was oh okay I I'm out of society feel
6:55 like um for so many so many years I said
6:59 I want to do something and I took action
7:03 as the turning point and then I find a
7:06 master study in Hat TV it's actually not
7:10 focus on data science is part of it's
7:12 called data science project management
7:14 is a combination of the program we
7:17 learned uh R and statistic models
7:22 um and advanc uh data analyze
7:26 but yeah but I was not satisfied with
7:30 this because that doesn't make me to be
7:33 a data scientist at that time was like
7:37 so cool like theater
7:39 [laughter and clears throat] I remember
7:40 but nowadays it's another story and yeah
7:44 and then I also took a a lot of courses
7:48 in Kosara of deep learning from Andrew
7:52 NG
7:54 um so he inspired me a lot and yeah I
7:58 had broad um u knowledge of yeah machine
8:03 learning and deep learning and also did
8:06 my master study in
8:08 um in MFP but nowadays yes everything's
8:12 and it's history now
8:15 >> well for me also I started with Andrea
8:18 and NG and um he has amazing courses and
8:23 so I I think when I started it was just
8:25 one course but I think they split it
8:27 into like specialization and stuff right
8:32 >> okay so how was uh so in studies you
8:35 used Right did you have to. Did you ever
8:39 use R outside of studies?
8:41 >> No.
8:42 >> No, [laughter]
8:44 [gasps]
8:44 >> I did. Yeah, I had a internship which
8:47 required Python. I was not that good. It
8:50 was beginning not to learn and yeah,
8:53 that was a very bad experience. Oh, you
8:56 don't know Python? [laughter]
8:57 But yeah, I know only R at that time.
9:00 >> How did you get this internship? So
9:02 maybe right now it's a little different.
9:07 um the challenges that people have but I
9:09 assume for you was also not super
9:11 straightforward uh especially since you
9:14 studied R they wanted Python. So how was
9:17 it for you like was it easy for you to
9:19 find internship and what did you do? It
9:21 was not easy at all like yeah to find
9:24 the first internship and later to find
9:27 the first job of course it's uh very
9:30 difficult um and uh also I have to also
9:35 take care of two children like in kona
9:37 time.
9:39 >> Oh no yeah I can imagine or I cannot
9:42 imagine. Yeah. [laughter]
9:44 [gasps] Um and actually I got that
9:46 internship um partly also because of my
9:51 automotive engineering background. So
9:53 they their con consultants uh which ends
9:59 to consult um OEMs as automotive
10:03 and they had not practical interviews
10:07 more a lot of theory u machine learning.
10:10 So actually what uh the courses from
10:13 Andrew NG helped me a lot like uh um and
10:17 they they oh yeah we will do only we
10:19 have to add practical interview later
10:22 because I was not that good at that time
10:25 uh with Python
10:27 >> and yeah it was it was okay the
10:31 internship I didn't learn so much. Yeah.
10:35 >> Mhm. But uh what you said what I heard
10:38 from you is your experience with
10:40 automotive helped your background helped
10:43 to get this and uh actually for me it
10:46 was the same story. So I before
10:49 I started doing data science I was a
10:51 Java developer.
10:52 >> Mhm.
10:53 >> And they needed somebody with Java
10:55 experience in the team. So this is how I
10:58 got my first data science job. So I
11:00 guess uh I I hear these stories that uh
11:02 when you transition your career what
11:05 often happens is your previous
11:06 background actually helps and you need
11:08 to take uh advantage of what you have.
11:10 You need to tell people hey this is what
11:12 I have that's why I can be useful for
11:14 you right
11:15 >> yeah definitively I agree with that
11:18 every experience you have will help some
11:21 somehow later also I as I said not in
11:24 between um of my two children I also get
11:27 some job like it's not related to
11:30 anything what I studied it's important
11:33 export basis but because of this
11:35 experience I could uh get um um get
11:40 admit from the uh university because
11:42 they required this applied university
11:45 required one year of uh working
11:47 experience. So without that would be
11:50 also nothing. So I actually appreciate
11:54 um yeah each experience and what I also
11:58 really good at is I can learn
12:01 even uh every uh uh always something out
12:05 of one person or or something. Yeah.
12:09 >> Interesting. What do you do as an import
12:11 expert uh in this in this area?
12:15 >> Uh yeah, it's it's uh [laughter] buying
12:20 uh export German goods and to China
12:23 market online platforms and yeah and
12:26 import Chinese uh goods to Yeah. German.
12:31 >> Yeah.
12:31 >> So I guess you're you're from China
12:33 originally, right? Mhm.
12:35 >> So they were looking for people who
12:37 speak Chinese and German, right?
12:40 >> Yes.
12:40 >> Uhhuh. Okay.
12:42 >> So it's nothing really what I started.
12:45 >> Yeah. Well, but at least it helped you
12:46 to get started, right? And then like
12:48 when you're in Germany
12:50 >> Yeah.
12:51 >> Yeah. You probably want to do something.
12:53 >> Yeah. It's it's at the Yeah. At the
12:56 beginning was Yeah. It's difficult to
12:58 find
12:59 >> find something. Mhm.
13:01 >> So you can just make it the best out of
13:04 it. Yeah.
13:05 >> And then at some point you came across
13:07 our courses, our Zoom camps, right? Tell
13:09 can you tell us more about that? How did
13:11 it happen?
13:12 >> Yeah. Um I said I did a lot of courses
13:15 in Kosara, Udemy
13:18 and other online platforms. Um it's a
13:23 lot of time very theory. Um but it's
13:26 also not bad because I can have a broad
13:28 knowledge. Um but then um actually I
13:32 follow you at the very beginning. I know
13:34 you start from the corona time. I was
13:36 also at home with two children and and
13:39 write my master thesis at that time. And
13:43 yeah the two I took two uh courses uh uh
13:47 zoom camp. One is u data engineering
13:49 zoom camp the other is uh m ops um zoom
13:53 camp.
13:55 Um both are very challenge and uh
13:59 helpful for me bec
14:04 I I have to use docker telephone and
14:07 cloud is so much so overwhelming at the
14:11 beginning but for the second for the
14:14 second time second zoom camp is much
14:16 easier.
14:17 >> Yeah.
14:18 >> Yeah. this push me like to to learn very
14:22 fast and uh and also I did other um um
14:27 projects not to complete this. I still
14:30 remember uh automata automatic um um uh
14:35 end to end data pipeline I built and it
14:39 was very nice dashboard at that time I
14:41 built about CO2 uh and uh and I could
14:46 use this skills directly uh in the
14:49 interviews uh and also at work. Um I
14:54 said I have to thank you uh because I it
14:57 helped me landed two jobs. Why is that?
15:00 >> Yeah. Big four as that one is at the
15:03 current company. So [laughter]
15:06 >> what help uh what helped most from these
15:09 uh courses? Was it projects? Was it uh I
15:13 don't know the skills you picked or what
15:14 exactly? Um I think the design of the
15:18 courses uh is quite good because it's
15:20 really the um
15:24 the um the use case what we see in daily
15:28 work and also the instructors uh were
15:31 also mix up professional from the other
15:35 companies. Uh yeah, I really I think
15:38 their contribution are really good and
15:40 they bring their perspectives uh into
15:42 this courses and of course the final
15:45 projects you combine all what you
15:48 learned and really to build a portfolio
15:52 and this is actually I'm looking for for
15:55 interview like if the person are
15:58 motivated motivated and also can do
16:01 everything alone you know
16:04 >> independently and
16:06 >> Mhm.
16:07 >> the value.
16:08 >> Yeah. I'm curious. So, you have two
16:10 kids. You uh back then you worked and
16:14 you were doing these courses and these
16:15 courses are not easy like especially for
16:18 um like with um your type of profile
16:21 when you didn't uh uh you had not used
16:24 docker, you had not used terraform, you
16:26 had not used cloud. So I imagine that
16:29 was pretty challenging especially like
16:31 module number one in the data
16:33 engineering course for people who don't
16:35 uh who who did not have pri prior
16:38 experience with these things sometimes
16:39 they struggle so module number one in
16:42 our data engineering course unexpectedly
16:44 turned out to be one of the most
16:46 difficult modules and I thought it would
16:48 be the easiest one because okay you just
16:51 do docker run and then things work that
16:53 was my expectation but like uh
16:55 >> that was very far from the reality. So,
16:59 how did you
17:01 manage to do this? Cuz I don't know,
17:04 maybe your kids were in kindergarten and
17:06 I remember I had to pick up my son
17:09 around like 3:00 p.m. right from
17:12 kindergarten. Uh, and then you also had
17:15 a job and also at the same time and I I
17:18 have just one kid but you have two. Um,
17:22 at the same time you do all these
17:23 courses. Uh, unbelievable. like did you
17:26 have to do this at night or when like
17:28 how did you manage your time?
17:30 >> Exactly. Um I said from the uh 2018 I I
17:37 spend a lot of nights like
17:40 >> um from 900 p.m. to like midnight is
17:44 every day two three hours. So it's a
17:47 habit for me like to learn courses and
17:50 to do the yeah do the projects because I
17:54 was as I said I was out of like society
17:58 [laughter] so long I was um I'm
18:00 observing the knowledge I'm so thirsty
18:03 and hungry for the knowledge and uh like
18:06 absorbing it like a spo sponge
18:10 and yeah I was not at that time I was
18:14 feel not tired because I I was also very
18:17 curious of how it works. I even took
18:20 also like uh web uh web development
18:24 which is actually nothing with devel um
18:26 with data science but I want to
18:29 understand not the it how it works how
18:32 how the website and how even the uh I
18:36 took also the web uh the also uh webcam
18:40 um about the AI EOS development
18:45 [laughter]
18:46 was yeah to understand how it works
18:48 works. Um, yeah, and that's that's
18:51 >> yeah, that's cool. I I think uh like
18:55 everyone who programs at some point will
18:57 benefit from uh a web development
19:00 course, especially now when it's so easy
19:02 to create an application, a web
19:05 application with AI tools. Uh but these
19:08 um tools will create a lot of code that
19:11 you will not understand unless you have
19:13 basic knowledge of React and stuff. And
19:16 for me I am u lucky that at some point I
19:20 decided hey like what is this react
19:22 thing maybe I should spend like a couple
19:24 of months trying to understand
19:26 and now like when I see AI is doing some
19:30 stuff I can actually try to read it try
19:32 to understand and try to ask like hey is
19:34 this really necessary why this is so
19:36 complicated right
19:38 >> uh so I think it's really helpful even
19:40 though now I don't I I don't
19:42 >> need to write web programs
19:45 >> Mhm. But I can at least review them and
19:48 it's super cool.
19:50 >> So I I wanted to ask you so you said you
19:55 because of the courses you got a job
19:58 twice, right? So can you tell us more
20:01 what was the first job and what was the
20:03 second one?
20:05 The first one is um uh as a a AI and as
20:10 a AI and data consultants in a big
20:14 consultance company
20:17 and yeah the interview question was like
20:20 uh this was a machine learning um u
20:23 machine learning interview and uh that's
20:26 why I was I reviewed also machine
20:28 learning zoom camp [laughter]
20:30 because I had I already know it but just
20:33 to re review some concept and it's
20:35 helped me to to present it well.
20:38 >> Nice.
20:39 >> Yeah, that I got me the first job and
20:42 the second is yeah the data engineer as
20:44 I said I I started as a data engineer in
20:48 an ov game beha and uh and also our tech
20:52 is AWS and uh also docker so terraform.
20:57 So actually I benefit a lot uh from the
21:01 courses and I can um also um do further
21:06 as a go deeper um with the data work.
21:10 >> Okay. And um you started ANOVA as um
21:16 data engineer but now you're head of
21:19 head of what? Head of data.
21:20 >> Yeah data and cloud.
21:22 >> So can you tell us more about this
21:24 transitioning? So you joined uh so first
21:26 of all you were taking all these courses
21:28 and uh um yeah with these courses you
21:32 were able to get your individual
21:35 contributor position and then you stayed
21:38 there for some time you got promoted so
21:40 can you tell us more what happened like
21:43 how did you and how did you understand
21:45 okay yes I want to be head of data
21:49 >> um actually was not the plan was
21:51 [laughter]
21:52 I never I I'm very spontaneous first I
21:55 don't plan [laughter]
21:56 uh my my life like in three years in
21:59 five years in 10 years uh so it just
22:02 comes um and actually I I just imagine
22:06 myself like okay I started as data
22:08 engineer
22:10 um and I can go deeper and someday I can
22:12 become a senior data engineer and can
22:15 mentor the other juniors
22:18 um um but I think the it's the
22:22 transition Um it's um maybe the trigger
22:26 is like um there's uh uh in our company
22:31 there is a data science um uh working
22:35 group like called is a is in German uh
22:38 it's like a internet communication that
22:42 um the pe the uh the data people like
22:46 across a team we have this group we uh
22:50 we uh exchange our knowledge age. We we
22:55 um also do pictures and do go together
22:58 to the events and uh yeah I was before I
23:03 was even also in the in the consultants
23:07 um also my first job as a researcher
23:10 that I was uh often alone on the uh like
23:14 on a project and then to have this
23:17 community was wow I want to contribute
23:20 so it's the shift like Okay to from
23:23 individividual like to a a community
23:26 builder. So I talked to the the
23:29 responsible at that time so I want to
23:31 contribute and he said okay I don't have
23:34 so much time and I okay then I take the
23:38 responsibility then I made a lot of
23:42 initi initiative which is also one of
23:47 the um game changers kind something that
23:50 you win um you uh through the
23:53 initiatives
23:55 uh like um I I started um uh AWS
24:00 certification um uh sprints like to uh
24:06 the colleague the data colleagues can
24:08 certification get trainings and uh we
24:12 have the funding from WS and we have
24:15 also uh initiatives like going to uh um
24:20 uh event um also for women to to promote
24:26 more diversity.
24:29 Um you know this and this um this
24:32 initiatives like make me the change.
24:36 Okay. I not only do the technically I
24:40 debug and this make me also satis
24:42 satisfied but then I have more impact
24:45 through my work.
24:46 >> I help more people like uh I empower
24:50 more um colleagues. Um so let's was a
24:54 mindset shift and then was then was the
24:58 time coming like there's a transition in
25:01 the company so and the the head of the
25:04 data left the company the senior
25:08 >> so there was a big um big uh hole like
25:13 uh uh gap um that we have a lot to do
25:16 but we don't have the people that comp
25:19 competent
25:20 >> uh for this and I is the person who has
25:23 most of knowledge of um AWS and I say
25:27 even it's not my role like not in my
25:30 team I say uh we have to do something so
25:32 I take I took the responsibility I say
25:35 okay um and I was also able like to do
25:40 my daily work and also take this
25:43 responsibility
25:45 um
25:45 >> unbelievable [laughter]
25:49 so good at things like for me when I
25:51 became uh like when I transitioned from
25:54 uh senior to like more technical
25:57 leadership role I could not do my
26:00 previous work like I needed to focus on
26:02 other things and so for me it was
26:04 meetings mentoring so I wasn't a manager
26:07 at first I was like a technical leader a
26:10 tech lead but still my day changed
26:14 completely and I had to work with so
26:16 many people so I didn't have time to do
26:19 things I used to be able to too but you
26:22 say you were able to do your daily work
26:24 but plus in addition to that you could
26:27 manage people
26:28 >> no no at that times I don't manage
26:30 people I just only take the work that's
26:34 supposed from the other team or take uh
26:37 take the
26:38 >> discordination work or
26:41 >> from what I understood from your story
26:43 so you were first uh taking some
26:45 initiatives in internal communities and
26:47 stuff but then at some point the head of
26:49 data left and there was a gap and you
26:51 started to feel in or uh take some of
26:56 these responsibilities right while still
26:58 doing your daily work.
27:00 >> Yeah.
27:00 >> Yes. It's not Yeah. My daily and also um
27:04 I think I don't take the person uh the
27:07 management the personal management but
27:10 because the senior uh uh the cloud
27:13 engineer left that was a big gap. Uh I
27:15 see I see
27:16 >> the infrastructure and all the system
27:19 works that I step in. So more
27:21 technically
27:23 but at the moment yeah it's as a head of
27:25 data [laughter]
27:26 it's as you said uh I don't have time
27:28 for for
27:29 >> I understand.
27:31 >> Yeah it's
27:32 >> uh so how does your day look like now?
27:36 >> Oh it's very busy.
27:39 >> Very busy.
27:40 >> Yeah. also because um now it's um the
27:45 third month um join um I'm joined this
27:49 team and so I was busy with the team
27:53 building um like to bring the new new
27:57 structure and routine to the team and um
28:01 also second is I I'm basic like we also
28:05 to prioritize uh the projects because we
28:09 have some depths like it was really one
28:11 year that we we don't have had a data or
28:14 or the senior was a stop um um uh of
28:20 recording. So it's a lot of depth that
28:22 we have to first um yeah um do it finish
28:27 this and then for innovative um projects
28:32 like uh AI maybe next year and mostly
28:36 what I'm mostly busy is to get budget
28:40 resource.
28:41 >> Oh sounds so familiar. Yeah. And it's
28:45 quite important um and um Yes. And also
28:51 to assess the projects and plan for next
28:54 year. Yeah.
28:57 >> How did you learn all these things? So
28:58 you said you just uh it's been like
29:01 around 100 days since you started doing
29:03 this and uh before that you were doing
29:07 more senior technical
29:10 things.
29:11 >> Um so how was it for you? what did you
29:13 use to prepare yourself? What kind of
29:17 resources? Uh how did you manage to uh I
29:20 don't know do all these things in the
29:23 last 100 days?
29:25 >> So yeah it's now it's 780 not 100 yet
29:30 but yeah uh so one of um one one I have
29:36 to thank is my previous team like my
29:39 previous manager team lead. I learned so
29:41 much from the team and also from from
29:45 the team lead um because that is the
29:48 role model for me that I I don't have to
29:52 do start from scratch so that I can
29:56 >> you just observed how they work how the
29:58 team lead works and then you try to
30:01 >> copy
30:02 >> and do the same okay
30:03 >> yeah do something because I I feel auto
30:06 it's very it's working very well and the
30:09 team spirit period is there and uh
30:12 that's why I yeah I don't have to study
30:16 uh from zero and secondly I as I said
30:20 you have to you don't have to do alone
30:23 so I immediately book a a course like a
30:28 coaching course
30:29 >> uh and uh with um with um that that
30:34 helps me because uh leadership is
30:36 nothing more than a new language or new
30:40 field they also have uh frameworks and
30:43 tools so uh it's there's no one like
30:47 born as leader but I think if you are
30:50 interested um in people and can do
30:54 reflection um you can be also a good
30:57 leader
30:59 >> in terms of uh resources did you come
31:02 across any book that helped you or any
31:06 online course or something
31:08 >> um yeah I I took uh one courses um from
31:13 the Hula Academy. I can recommend um and
31:18 >> going to say it again. Which academy?
31:20 >> H
31:22 how academy?
31:24 >> Okay.
31:25 >> Yeah.
31:25 >> Is it something in in Germany?
31:28 >> Yeah. Yeah. It's institute like a lot of
31:32 uh howful academic like they they they
31:36 provide a lot of um courses not only
31:40 leadership but the trainer uh the
31:44 trainer was really nice
31:46 [laughter and gasps]
31:47 and that helped me to reflect and um
31:50 yeah also
31:53 yeah give you some tools uh really um on
31:57 the hand um that help. Um this the
32:02 second book is not really internship but
32:06 um general how to get uh with people.
32:09 It's how to win friends and influence
32:12 people but
32:13 >> okay
32:13 >> uh I think this is also one very famous
32:16 classic book. Um
32:20 yes.
32:22 >> Yeah. There's a movie that is called How
32:24 to Lose Friends and Alienate People.
32:26 Have you seen it?
32:28 No,
32:30 >> it's a dark English comedy. U sometimes
32:34 like you know these English comedies
32:35 they are a little too dark, right? I
32:37 think this is one of those. [gasps]
32:40 Yeah. [laughter] Okay. I never managed
32:43 to finish this book to be honest like
32:45 how to win friends and influence people.
32:47 I tried multiple times but
32:49 >> yeah it's I guess I don't have the
32:52 patience to uh to sit and read through.
32:56 I have I got I read this book on the
32:58 trip to uh in in Canada that I have
33:01 nothing to
33:01 >> Okay. It's a long trip.
33:03 >> Yeah. In one in one
33:05 apartment he has this book. Okay.
33:07 [laughter]
33:08 >> Ah okay. So you came to Canada and in
33:12 your Airbnb there was was the book.
33:14 >> Yeah. I find it's it's something some
33:16 Yeah. Some really reasonable but
33:19 difficult to do it. But I I agree some
33:23 of really opinion what they say. Yeah.
33:28 >> Yeah. I I see there are a few questions
33:30 from the audience wanted to uh cover
33:32 them before we continue with um the rest
33:35 of questions. Um so there is a person uh
33:41 who says he um so they uh
33:46 spend a lot of time programming uh and
33:49 then drifted to management and now they
33:51 want to get back to uh data and AI. Um
33:56 do you have any recommendations how can
33:57 they do this? So I guess they were doing
34:00 individual contributions then they
34:02 became managers and now they want to be
34:04 uh individual contributors again in the
34:06 space of data and AI. Um do you have any
34:09 recommendations for them? Um um this is
34:13 also something I I I
34:17 thought about it before I should I
34:20 really do it during people every day
34:23 like actually I'm very I I like also
34:26 programming
34:27 solving solving complex problems and was
34:30 also a lot bring me also a lot of
34:33 >> but you you don't have a chance to do
34:35 this anymore right as a head of data you
34:37 have like all this budget planning and
34:39 stuff
34:39 >> yeah I was I I thought I could have
34:42 maybe 20% the time to do it, but
34:46 >> I thought too it was very naive of me.
34:48 Yeah. Uh but before our interview today,
34:51 I could um code terapform refactoring
34:55 and terapform code with one of my
34:57 colleagues.
34:58 >> So I do try give my best. I think it's
35:02 important. Um but to this question, I
35:05 can only suggest like to talk with his
35:09 or her manager about it if the culture
35:14 um is open and supportive. I think um it
35:19 should be yeah you can find a way
35:22 because
35:23 >> it's good that you try it and you find
35:26 it's not your thing um then you should
35:29 make a change it doesn't make any sense
35:32 if you just stick and not happy that
35:34 that doesn't good
35:37 >> so maybe what I can add is in the last
35:40 company where I worked the company is
35:42 called oilix uh we had two career tracks
35:45 the individual contributor track and the
35:48 management track. I think it's common in
35:50 many companies. So in the individual
35:53 contributor track you have these
35:54 technical leadership roles like staff
35:57 engineer uh principal engineer and in
36:00 the leadership roles in the sorry in the
36:03 management roles in the management track
36:05 you have uh manager data science manager
36:08 or I don't know engineering manager and
36:10 then head of data head of engineering
36:12 whatever right and then it was actually
36:16 possible to do how was called lateral
36:19 moves like if you're head of data
36:21 the
36:24 how do I say the position at the same
36:25 level in the technical track would be
36:27 principal right so then ahead of data I
36:29 could say hey I want to
36:32 um try being more hands-on how about I
36:36 transition to the principal role and
36:38 I've seen many people do this right so
36:41 they uh from being head of data they
36:44 became uh principles and u the other way
36:47 around also works like if somebody's
36:48 hands-on but they want to be a little
36:51 bit more how to say uh like managerial
36:56 uh setting the
36:59 you know strategic stuff doing strategic
37:02 stuff. So then uh it was also possible
37:04 to transition from like principle to
37:06 head.
37:08 >> Yeah. So maybe if your company is big
37:10 and you have this clear career tracks
37:14 could be possible to change.
37:16 >> Yes. I think he or she could have
37:20 already have a overview and have a
37:23 responsibility and it's easier to do
37:25 this transit and
37:28 >> if it's yeah if it's possible it depends
37:31 a lot on the company
37:33 >> I also have to make a plug uh about our
37:36 courses right uh because if you have
37:39 free time then right now in January we
37:43 start the data engineering course so uh
37:46 this is a good moment to actually get
37:48 into this and tomorrow we start a course
37:52 which is about AI dev tools it's called
37:55 AI dev tools for zoom camp where we show
37:58 how to use tools like corsor github
38:00 copilot and [snorts] other things to
38:03 make you a better or more effective
38:05 engineer right so if you're interested
38:07 in this kind of stuff you can go to our
38:11 web page data talks.comclub and then
38:14 you'll find out more about the courses
38:15 we
38:16 That sounds interesting. Actually, I
38:18 registered but I don't know I have time
38:21 for it. I tested also we I tried to
38:24 evaluate the AI tools and not for the
38:28 company. [snorts] Um I personally use
38:31 also cursor to to build my website to do
38:35 some uh
38:37 >> pro prototyping actually very surprise
38:40 with the
38:41 >> actually for me as a former manager and
38:44 like since I worked for quite some time
38:46 in technical leadership I started losing
38:48 my skills uh maybe some of you have
38:51 already heard this story but I started
38:53 losing my skills as a software engineer
38:55 as a developer. So for me now having
38:58 access to these tools make me more
39:00 productive. So I can be as productive as
39:03 before when I was an individual
39:05 contributor even though some things are
39:07 a little a little bit more more rusty
39:09 than before. [snorts] Um but now I can
39:14 be as productive as I was when I was a
39:16 senior data scientist or when I was like
39:18 I don't know a developer because I could
39:21 produce so much code and I really liked
39:23 the code I was doing. So now I can do
39:27 the same thing but even maybe faster
39:30 with all these AI tools. So that's
39:32 really cool.
39:33 >> Um, another question is uh from Rupa and
39:37 they have six years of experience um but
39:39 they live in India now they are learning
39:42 German
39:43 >> and they want to find a job in Germany.
39:45 So I don't know Rupa does not mention
39:48 does not specify if they are still in
39:50 India or already in Germany but do you
39:53 know any companies uh who would um
39:57 hire somebody internationally and
39:59 relocate to Germany?
40:01 >> Um this question I can [laughter] not
40:04 really give
40:05 >> you don't know. Yeah, but I do what I
40:08 can add is just learn German is very
40:11 very important if you want to move to
40:14 Germany. It's as important as
40:16 >> Rupa is in Germany already.
40:18 >> Ah okay then. Okay. Yeah. Um
40:25 um yeah the international big companies
40:28 I think um at the moment the job market
40:32 is very competitive. We have also some
40:35 open links outside as data engineer,
40:39 cloud engineer.
40:41 Um they're very
40:42 >> you have some innov
40:48 >> uh I think one now is one data scientist
40:51 um positions out but we require like B2
40:55 at this B2
40:59 >> German level. Uh that's why I and also I
41:03 have to say the German um German
41:06 language helped me uh very to find good
41:11 job at the to find uh my first job at
41:14 the beginning because um the most of the
41:18 English was very competitive in one hour
41:20 there were 200. Yeah, I've heard about
41:23 this also from a few people that um
41:28 focusing on German companies where there
41:30 is less competition in [clears throat]
41:32 uh so for example when I worked at Elix
41:35 and it was after co uh when we open when
41:38 we would open a data science position we
41:41 would have 100 applications within
41:43 minutes of opening
41:45 >> and I don't know how people even managed
41:48 to do this right it's like did they
41:50 watch the website or they subscribe to
41:53 LinkedIn. It was and like when you have
41:56 100 applications within I don't know one
41:59 day it's like okay how do I go through
42:02 all these people now uh most of them
42:04 were actually not even remotely
42:07 qualified but then uh for me as a hiring
42:10 manager and for our um talent
42:13 specialists they they had to like go
42:15 through the all these applications and
42:16 understand okay who is good who is not
42:19 good like who is a good match. So then I
42:22 guess uh when you target German
42:24 companies you have a little less
42:25 competition.
42:26 >> Yes, definitely. Yeah.
42:30 >> So I found a link to your careers page
42:34 and they shared it in um in the live
42:37 chat and Rupa says they have B2 in
42:40 German which I think is more than enough
42:42 to work right.
42:44 >> Just keep on eye on it. As I said, so
42:48 maybe more opportunities coming next
42:51 year. Mhm.
42:52 >> Yeah. Well, I hope the link I shared
42:54 will help. Maybe you will become
42:56 colleagues soon. [laughter]
42:58 Uh
43:00 uh how did you learn German and how
43:02 would you recommend to do this for
43:04 people in Berlin?
43:06 Um
43:08 um I had at the very beginning I had the
43:10 intensive courses and then after like uh
43:14 seven eight years like I I use I speak
43:18 uh and use German every day but I roam
43:21 with bad grammatic or thing and last
43:26 year actually I um like retook one year
43:30 German courses with a teacher um
43:34 individual your teacher in Berlin. I can
43:37 also share the link later. She was also
43:40 really good. Um and if you um it depends
43:46 uh which face you are you can have so
43:48 like intensive every day two or three
43:51 hours or you have already good knowledge
43:54 and maybe just specific to one point
43:57 that you can improve it that would be um
44:02 good. So for me I also took the
44:04 intensive courses. I don't know is if
44:07 they were from the same school. I took
44:09 the ones in Deutsche Deutsche Academy
44:12 which have a office not far from me on
44:15 Alexander part and they have um this uh
44:18 morning classes which I really find
44:21 found convenient cuz I can do the
44:23 classes in the morning and then the rest
44:24 of the day I can still work and do
44:26 stuff. But if I learn I tried learning
44:29 German in the evening but after work my
44:32 brain was that like I it was refusing
44:34 any German at all.
44:36 >> Yeah.
44:36 >> So like for me this is what worked doing
44:38 German in the morning and then working
44:41 but yeah maybe somebody's like me and
44:45 >> yeah if they have time because I I I do
44:48 challenge that most people work full
44:51 time. It was also at that time I yeah I
44:54 stay at home with [laughter] pregnant so
44:56 I do have the time I I really precious
44:59 that I do use this time like to learn
45:02 Germany and to learn driving lessons
45:04 like [laughter] which I don't have time
45:06 for that
45:09 >> yeah well this is another thing why to
45:11 me morning classes helped it was easier
45:14 to allocate time to that
45:16 >> but uh then I already back then I
45:19 already left so I was working on data
45:21 talks club entirely fully focusing on
45:24 it.
45:24 >> So for me it was easier because I was my
45:26 own manager. For me it was easier to
45:30 distribute time right? Uh so I for
45:32 example sometimes I didn't have to work
45:34 like 40 hours right I could allow myself
45:36 to work less. Oh sometimes I would work
45:38 more but then cuz I'm my own boss I can
45:40 do whatever you want but like when you
45:42 work uh at a usual company it's a little
45:45 bit more difficult I guess. Okay another
45:48 question. How would you recommend to
45:49 start career in cloud and data?
45:52 >> Um build uh take take Alex [laughter]
45:58 courses and build a project like I said
46:00 I I recommend the data engineering um
46:04 yeah the data engineering zoom camp it's
46:07 you you have to like yeah all the take
46:11 uh you have to learn all the tech and
46:13 what we learn every we use every day
46:15 really in [laughter] our company. So
46:18 also the telephone code and and to write
46:21 telephone and uh um yeah build um
46:26 projects. Yeah. And um I think for the
46:30 consultants um if you I don't know if
46:33 someone like certification
46:36 that is something like yeah not everyone
46:39 like do it. I know it's a lot of theory
46:42 but sometimes also the to open a door
46:47 like because of consultants company they
46:49 do require um this certification that
46:53 might also help um and yeah if you have
46:57 time you can also do it. So the
46:59 combination of uh theory and also
47:02 project.
47:03 >> Mhm. And I also I never took any I never
47:08 took any like formal certification uh
47:12 like AWS certification or anything
47:15 >> but I remember I I wanted to learn uh
47:18 about AWS. I was only starting with AWS
47:22 and I came across a course um about AWS
47:25 preparing for AWS certification and in
47:28 that course I didn't watch the entire
47:30 course I watched a few modules but then
47:34 it I finally understood IM roles like in
47:37 AWS cuz I think for me it was the
47:39 biggest um like I'm trying to come up
47:43 with a good word uh so it's not censored
47:47 on YouTube uh like what's the biggest
47:50 challenge like [laughter]
47:52 roles cuz it was so confusing and per
47:54 perplexed. Uh so I never took the
47:58 certificate but preparation for the
48:00 certificate was actually useful
48:02 >> and yeah yeah and the same with German
48:05 right. So like the reason I actually did
48:08 the German classes cuz I wanted to apply
48:11 for citiz citizenship and in order to
48:13 have to apply for citizenship I have to
48:15 have B1 and I thought okay B1 is maybe I
48:19 aim for B2 and then I started preparing
48:21 for the certificate and because of the
48:24 preparation now my German my level of
48:26 German is way higher than it was before.
48:29 So at the end I don't really care about
48:30 the certificate but the preparation
48:33 >> for that was helpful
48:35 >> the commitment that's why I also it
48:38 helped me a lot like I said I set a goal
48:41 and I usually I just fed once but
48:45 usually I can yeah I give my commitment
48:49 and reach that goal I set and that's
48:52 exactly um you can
48:54 >> how do you do this is it new year
48:56 resolution or
48:57 >> how do you do goal setting
48:59 >> no like data uh engineer don't come you
49:02 have a deadline then I
49:04 >> right okay
49:04 >> and also [clears throat] certification
49:06 okay I I book uh exam that does this
49:09 deadline and then apply
49:12 >> okay I I thought you have like a more
49:14 formal process for yourself like okay
49:17 this year I want to achieve this and
49:19 this and that and but I agree you have a
49:22 when you have a deadline like for
49:24 example with I mentioned this example of
49:26 a German certificate
49:28 I have the deadline. I have to be ready
49:30 by this deadline. So now no matter what
49:33 I try to prepare myself and it really
49:36 helps right of that deadline.
49:38 >> Next time we can do podcast of German
49:41 right [laughter]
49:45 >> like I can order donor uh but having a
49:52 Germans like um
49:55 small talk and for me it's always
49:56 awkward.
49:57 >> [laughter]
49:59 >> small talk is the most I can do.
50:03 >> Yeah. I mean, if I if I'm forced to work
50:07 in German, then probably I'll get to
50:10 >> Yeah.
50:10 >> you know, a level when I can actually
50:13 have a podcast in German.
50:15 >> But if possible to avoid that, I would
50:18 do for now. [laughter]
50:21 >> But you use German more often than
50:23 English, do you?
50:24 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. also at the current
50:27 company before also was English.
50:30 >> That's why also the push. Yeah. You have
50:32 to use it then.
50:33 >> Yeah. Yeah.
50:34 >> Better. Yeah.
50:35 >> Okay. There's one section of our
50:37 questions that we prepared that we
50:39 didn't cover which is inclusion and
50:41 mentorship and um since you have this
50:45 experience of being a mom and then of
50:47 two kids which I guess is more difficult
50:50 than one kid. Um and uh yeah I wonder
50:54 like
50:55 Well, do you do mentorship like do you
50:58 help other women who are who are in the
51:01 same situation like you were a couple of
51:03 years ago? Uh do you help them?
51:06 >> Um yes. Um because um this journey was
51:11 actually mostly of this journey I was
51:14 alone a a lot um because I have to
51:17 figure out everything myself and do the
51:20 decision. my husband doesn't know
51:22 anything about data and also the friend
51:25 um the connection um nothing um that's
51:29 why when I have I feel a little bit oh
51:32 now I have time a little bit free time
51:35 before I was learning a lot a lot and
51:38 then I say oh then I feel more
51:41 comfortable and I can have a free time
51:43 to give back and I I see I have also
51:47 friends uh a lot of women like stay at
51:52 home really because also I think uh
51:54 social system here in Germany like my
51:58 neighbors yeah a lot just stay at home
52:00 and I find it's really a pity because re
52:02 they really have master even doctor
52:06 degrees and I I find it's pity for me
52:09 it's no choice like to stay at home I
52:11 was feel not not so happy like I I feel
52:16 not very bad that that's I think that's
52:19 not good for the family of China.
52:20 [clears throat]
52:20 >> Do you think it's also Sorry,
52:22 interrupting you. Do you think it's also
52:24 cultural? Maybe in China it's more
52:27 common for women to work while here in
52:29 Germany um I agree. I also came across
52:32 this observation that uh a lot of women
52:35 stay at home for whatever reasons I
52:37 don't know. Um but it's more like
52:40 compared to Russia where I'm from
52:41 originally uh I think in Russia cuz I
52:44 guess maybe communist times women worked
52:46 more compared to Germany. Yeah, I think
52:50 one culture uh a little bit but also
52:53 yeah how much you afford know because in
52:57 China you have to work full time two
52:59 people together to raise a children it's
53:01 very expensive in Germany like it's also
53:05 you don't
53:07 need to work full time or even like it's
53:10 the system like because also the um I
53:15 don't so the married people the tax
53:18 division Like
53:19 >> right right
53:20 >> it motivates you. Why should I work
53:22 [laughter]
53:23 like for Yeah. 15.
53:26 >> So would you say because life in Germany
53:28 is easier. People tend to work less.
53:30 >> Oh. No. It's also a reason that people
53:32 Yeah. I don't need to work like forund
53:36 some hundred euro€,000 euro like it's
53:38 not much more and then if I hire someone
53:41 to do all the things that yeah of course
53:45 people calculate uh this is also one
53:48 reason and of course the second the
53:51 third maybe also yeah patron that in
53:54 China
53:57 um g uh um parents that take care more
54:01 together. Um but but yeah, I I do wish
54:06 like uh I that's why I also like to talk
54:10 to my daughter be yourself because she
54:13 sometimes told me I want she want to
54:15 have children. I know you're 80 years
54:18 old [laughter]
54:19 to be be yourself. I know it's very
54:22 difficult like to get out um and it's
54:26 especially for foreigners and um you
54:29 don't have so much support here
54:32 and that's why I the idea was to help
54:35 these women to get back to work. Um so I
54:39 initi uh initi I made an initiative uh
54:42 in my neighborhood uh I started a
54:45 working mom projects like um like um we
54:50 have a place also at neighbor they
54:53 provide me uh their living rooms they
54:56 some women come together and they help
54:58 them like to review the CVs and uh just
55:02 support them like they don't they not be
55:05 that alone like I I think that's enough
55:08 because they have to find their way
55:10 themsel um but not that alone like to
55:14 encourage to hear the other stories
55:16 because they know maybe really 10 years
55:19 because the children they wait and their
55:21 children like old enough but when it's
55:24 old enough then you miss your best time
55:27 like also at the age of 30 years I was
55:31 made decision to go back to university I
55:33 was also think okay 30 years okay I can
55:36 I'm still Yeah, [laughter] I was still
55:38 young. But if I say maybe now uh at 40
55:41 years, I was maybe maybe I made other
55:45 decisions. So [laughter]
55:47 that is um um one project but um now
55:52 it's just on hold. Um but now I mentor I
55:57 have little time but I mentor two women
56:00 at the moment three. So one is also
56:03 single mom and yeah um she doesn't work
56:07 five years and try to get again her
56:10 independence like and also help um a
56:15 young graduate to get the first job is
56:17 was so difficult in US and um I think
56:22 it's important like um yeah it's for me
56:24 like I want to give some um something
56:27 back um because I know this journey was
56:29 really hard especially for foreigners,
56:32 foreign women's. Yeah.
56:35 >> They wanted to get um so maybe they are
56:38 less lucky and they don't live in the
56:40 same neighborhood as you or another
56:42 person who is very who likes taking
56:44 initiative and they could create this
56:46 groups like working moms. Um is there
56:50 any meetup or resource you would
56:52 recommend? I heard about P ladies. I
56:54 don't know if they specifically f if
56:55 they have any focus uh on moms. I think
56:58 it's just in general for
57:00 >> in general for women.
57:01 >> Yeah.
57:02 >> Like enabling women, but um like if
57:05 somebody who has similar background to
57:08 what you did a few years ago,
57:10 >> what you would recommend for them to
57:12 look
57:13 >> I don't know online or to get
57:16 the port you were talking about.
57:19 >> Um yeah. So the pi ladies I was also
57:22 several times in their meetups and pi
57:25 day and now was recently I was more uh
57:28 engaged in the women in and big data in
57:31 Berlin. They also have a lot of events
57:35 um and also one organization the wounded
57:39 as also for freelancers
57:42 a little bit imprint entrepreneurship
57:46 journey. Um yeah that's you can follow
57:51 them in linking they have some nice um
57:54 also some mentorship program which which
57:56 I was at the m at the moment to have um
58:01 yeah support them for three months.
58:04 >> Thank you. I know we should be wrapping
58:05 up but uh I see a nice comment. I want
58:07 to just quickly read it. So the comment
58:10 is about um I'm also a working mom who
58:13 is taking a melism camp and your story
58:15 is absolutely inspiring. So thank you uh
58:18 for sharing your Scott story. Um would
58:21 you classify your background is in
58:24 automotive as technical background cuz
58:26 the question her question is what about
58:28 other backgrounds nontechnical ones in
58:30 your in her case she has a background in
58:33 applied linguistics. linguist. Okay. Um,
58:37 linguistic actually can be uh trans,
58:41 right?
58:41 >> Yeah, [laughter] actually.
58:43 >> Yeah. Uh, it's very easy actually. I
58:46 think um yeah, I what I would suggest is
58:51 find your passion, find your strengths,
58:54 not not just go to tech or just because
58:57 it's cool or AI. Redefine your
58:59 strengths. Um then you Yeah. then you
59:02 can do much better work that's I that's
59:06 all the like hard work that seems not
59:09 that that's [laughter]
59:11 uh difficult for me at that moment so
59:14 >> maybe what I would add is uh having some
59:17 background is always better than having
59:19 no background and you can use this
59:22 background so for example we were
59:23 talking about import expert right and
59:25 let's say there's a person who worked in
59:26 import expert now wants to become a
59:28 software engineer or data scientist so
59:30 what they can do is they can work in
59:32 import export domain and there they will
59:35 have an advantage over people who don't
59:37 have this experience because they have
59:38 the domain knowledge right even though
59:40 the experience might not be technical
59:43 but still
59:44 >> it is very relevant for the companies
59:46 who are automating this import export
59:49 and they building tools for that for
59:50 example right so then if you're applying
59:53 as a data scientist with this background
59:55 it will uh make your profile way more
59:58 interesting than others because you have
1:00:00 this domain knowledge and the same with
1:00:02 other things like in my case it was Java
1:00:04 it was a very technical thing right so I
1:00:06 was more technical than most data
1:00:08 scientists in the team that I joined uh
1:00:11 but it could be like anything right so
1:00:13 in your case it was automotive knowledge
1:00:15 um but could be like maybe I worked in
1:00:17 oil and petroleum uh and now I want to
1:00:20 so this is actually a real case from
1:00:22 somebody from the community so they
1:00:24 found a job as a data analyst in oil
1:00:26 petroleum company so their petroleum
1:00:28 engineering background was super helpful
1:00:31 um to do this. So yeah.
1:00:34 So yeah, thanks for sharing your story,
1:00:37 Char. Thanks for sharing also adding
1:00:39 this uh I'm sorry I don't know your name
1:00:42 but that you're a working mom who has
1:00:44 background in linguistics. Thanks for
1:00:46 sharing that too. I I hope things work
1:00:49 well for you and yeah, we should be
1:00:52 wrapping up. Um it's been an enormous
1:00:55 pleasure talking to you. Uh it's not the
1:00:58 first time. So before we met in private,
1:01:00 now we have this podcast and before that
1:01:02 we interacted online. So it's really
1:01:05 nice to
1:01:07 uh that we had you you on this uh
1:01:09 podcast interview. Uh so thanks a lot
1:01:12 for reaching out to me and suggesting to
1:01:13 share your story and maybe what I will
1:01:16 add is somebody else wants to share
1:01:19 their stories please don't hesitate to
1:01:21 reach out to me. Um so for me it's
1:01:23 always interesting to hear your stories
1:01:26 to hear how our Zoom camp courses helped
1:01:28 you and also it's interesting because it
1:01:31 will motivate the current students or
1:01:32 future students of the courses. So yeah
1:01:36 if you have a story you want to share
1:01:37 please let me know.
1:01:40 >> Thank you. Um
1:01:42 >> okay
1:01:42 >> and then have a nice day have nice
1:01:45 >> you too you too and [laughter] enjoy
1:01:47 being head of uh data uh
1:01:51 >> will [laughter] not be just budget
1:01:53 planning but also interesting strategic
1:01:55 work uh where yeah you'll build very
1:01:58 interesting things
1:02:00 >> yes I try [laughter]
1:02:01 >> okay have a nice day and bye everyone
