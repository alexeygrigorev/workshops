0:28 but usually I do it with with with
0:30 slides.
0:31 Now I have the question opened that we
0:36 and you prepared for this interview.
0:39 So if you're ready, we can start.
0:41 Yeah, I'm ready.
0:43 Yeah. This week we'll talk about data
0:45 science in healthcare and we have a
0:48 special guest today, Elena. Elena is a
0:50 machine learning researcher and
0:52 educator. She's passionate about using
0:54 data science to improve healthcare and
0:56 save human lives. Her expertise include
1:00 signal processing, deep learning and
1:02 datadriven design. Welcome.
1:05 Thank you. Also, thank you for the
1:07 invitation to the podcast. Um, I have
1:10 been following some previous podcasts
1:12 that you did some other talks, but I'm
1:16 also glad to meet you like that in live.
1:20 But I'm familiar like with this setting
1:22 and also seeing you but not
1:26 thanks. And yeah big thanks to Adonis
1:29 who recommended Elena and uh it's not
1:32 the first guest he recommends. So thanks
1:34 Adonis a lot
1:36 and also the questions for today's
1:38 interview are prepared by Johanna Byer.
1:40 Thanks a lot yana for your help and yeah
1:44 let's start um before we go into our
1:47 main topic of data science and
1:49 healthcare let's start with your
1:51 background can you tell us about your
1:53 career journey so far
1:55 so as I said I am Greek so I was born
1:59 and raised there I went to university
2:01 there uh in the university of patas I
2:04 did electrical and computer engineering
2:07 which is um a fiveyear year uh bachelor
2:11 and masters it's a joint degree and
2:15 during that studies
2:17 uh I did the rasmus and I did part of my
2:20 thesis in Brussels
2:22 and I stayed there for one year it was
2:25 my first international experience and
2:27 then I got excited
2:28 which university
2:29 h it was veu
2:33 so it was the dut
2:37 free university I studied in the French
2:40 one.
2:43 Yeah, exactly.
2:45 I also did some courses there because I
2:48 I needed also to pick up some courses.
2:50 So, I did also a bit of ULB.
2:53 Mhm.
2:53 Uh but mainly it was
2:55 Vub
2:57 and then after that I was excited about
3:00 going abroad and I applied for an
3:02 internship at Philips Healthcare in the
3:04 Netherlands. So I moved to the
3:07 Netherlands
3:09 and actually now the last seven years
3:12 I'm here
3:14 and I have been doing different things.
3:17 The main focus is always healthcare. Um
3:21 and I also worked there at Philips
3:24 Healthcare after some point. Uh then I
3:28 did the two-year engineering doctorate
3:31 diploma in data science. That's the only
3:34 thing that was not related to healthcare
3:36 because we were involved in multiple
3:38 projects and we worked with different
3:40 companies and organizations. But then
3:42 after that degree I got back again to
3:45 healthcare and I work for a startup um
3:49 working on developing monitoring systems
3:51 for vital signs for pediatric patients
3:55 in Africa. So that's in short my journey
3:58 but if you have questions you can ask me
4:01 we can go more in detail.
4:03 How's your Dutch?
4:05 It's good at the at this hood.
4:09 So around B1 level, let's say.
4:12 Okay. Yeah.
4:14 Yeah,
4:14 that's cuz like in the Netherlands,
4:16 everyone speaks English. So I guess it's
4:18 very difficult to actually learn and
4:20 practice that, right?
4:22 It's true. But I find it interesting and
4:25 also sometimes useful because some
4:28 things they are just written in Dutch or
4:30 sometimes I need to search something in
4:31 Dutch like I can find better results. So
4:35 that's why I'm a bit also stick and I
4:38 have also personal interest to learn. So
4:42 nice. So um well I have never heard
4:46 about Philips healthcare. So what I know
4:48 about Philips is they produce lamps.
4:51 Mhm. Um I have a few smart lamps uh you
4:53 know this Philips Hue then I I also know
4:57 they produce trimmers like for shaving
5:00 that also I know
5:03 but that's pretty much the extent of
5:05 what I know about Philips I know it's
5:07 like a gigantic gigantic company uh and
5:11 I know that the headquarters is in is in
5:14 Idaho right?
5:15 Mhm.
5:17 Like what does actually Philips
5:18 Healthcare do? Okay, they don't do lamps
5:21 anymore. They sold to the company. So
5:24 now the company with the lamps and like
5:26 the smart lighting and all those things
5:28 is called signify. And now Philips is
5:31 focusing on like home care like shaving
5:35 machines and things like that,
5:36 toothbrushes and also
5:40 like health care but like broadly care
5:43 of health at home in the hospitals they
5:46 do like uh also they have MI scans
5:51 um they have big machines as well. So I
5:53 worked also like uh I did my internship
5:56 in the um CT arm which is like a machine
6:01 used in the operation room and then I
6:05 worked when I was working at Philips
6:07 healthcare in the pregnancy department.
6:11 So they were like two different projects
6:14 focusing on different areas of
6:15 healthcare.
6:17 Yeah it's a huge company. M so what I
6:21 understood it's mostly about different
6:23 devices that people use like doctors use
6:26 for different things like be it the MRI
6:30 scans or um support in the operation
6:33 room or things like that.
6:34 Mhm. Yeah.
6:38 And at your current company um what do
6:42 you do? You mentioned uh is it it's
6:45 helping people in Africa. Maybe you can
6:47 tell us more. So actually I left my
6:50 current company in July. So I'm actually
6:53 now on sabbatical
6:55 but
6:56 I worked for them for almost two years.
7:00 And there I was focusing more on
7:04 designing
7:06 like what is the future of data science
7:08 in the company and how we can develop uh
7:11 data science into the vital sign
7:14 monitoring system we were working on.
7:18 uh that was actually um a system uh that
7:23 was recording vital signs like heart
7:26 rate, respiration rate, SP2 of pediatric
7:29 patients
7:29 devices like this uh variables or
7:32 something like more precise.
7:34 Uh so it was actually a system for the
7:37 intensive care unit.
7:40 Okay. But then the difference was that
7:42 um we were working on a design for low
7:45 resource settings and a more also
7:48 simplified design because uh sometimes
7:51 like healthcare professionals uh there
7:55 uh they might like find it more
7:57 convenient if they like the device is
7:59 simpler for them because actually a lot
8:03 of hospitals we were working with Malawi
8:05 and a lot of hospitals there they don't
8:07 have um monitoring systems.
8:14 Yeah. And I was actually mainly working
8:16 on the design on like because we were
8:20 involved in a data collection process.
8:23 We were collecting data and there was
8:25 this big question what we are going to
8:27 do with this data and how we can use it
8:30 to
8:32 yeah to predict vital signs for patients
8:35 to associate h lab tests. I had some
8:38 from lab test we were getting uh to
8:41 identify specific clinical outcomes.
8:44 So things like that but uh one of my
8:47 learnings there it's like that it's a
8:49 very long process from like starting
8:52 from the research part that I was mainly
8:54 focusing on into really integrating
8:57 those algorithms into the real setting
9:00 and making it like uh usable for people.
9:05 So as I understood the devices are
9:08 already there like all the things that
9:10 collect data from patients like all
9:12 these vital is already there and what
9:15 you were doing is thinking like okay we
9:18 have all this data how we can use it.
9:20 Mhm.
9:20 But the devices were also were there uh
9:23 because um we were part of a bigger
9:27 research project so they were installed
9:30 there for the purpose of the research.
9:33 Mhm. Okay. Yeah, that's quite
9:36 interesting. And you spent there like a
9:39 couple of years, right?
9:40 Mhm. Yeah.
9:42 Okay. So, I see. So, you started in
9:45 Philips healthcare and then you worked
9:47 in this company. Um what did why did you
9:51 decide to go into healthcare?
9:54 Why did you decide to choose this area?
9:56 Mhm. So
10:00 before choosing and going into
10:02 engineering, I had this big question
10:04 whether to go into studying for doctor
10:07 or engineering. Then I went for
10:10 engineering
10:11 uh because I was into math.
10:14 And then when the time came to decide on
10:18 what kind of thesis I want to do,
10:21 the only topic that I was finding most
10:24 interesting was topics related to
10:25 healthcare because there I was finding
10:28 that there is more uh impact directly on
10:32 people. Um I still remember for example
10:36 that there were some projects on
10:38 developing games and I was finding those
10:41 like for me personally not impactful
10:46 and then I choose for that and indeed it
10:50 was true that I was like feeling that my
10:54 work goes somewhere that can impact
10:57 people's lives. Mhm. your what was your
11:01 thesis topic?
11:03 So I worked together with IMC not sure
11:07 it's a Belgian research institute
11:10 and
11:11 there we were working I had images from
11:14 white blood cells
11:17 and I was analyzing those images with
11:21 like basic
11:23 um conventional image processing
11:26 methods. Uh and then the main goal was
11:29 to classify those images into
11:31 subcategories of white blood cells
11:34 and that was actually part of a bigger
11:37 project
11:38 uh because they were working on the
11:41 development of a cell sort they were
11:44 calling machine which was actually a
11:46 machine that they wanted to
11:50 filter the blood of people and to
11:53 classify the blood cells into
11:58 um like wood cells and cancerous cells
12:02 and they wanted to filter out the
12:04 cancerous cells
12:06 and then I was just working on a small
12:08 part of this project on the white blood
12:10 cells.
12:11 Mhm. Yeah. I was going to ask like why
12:14 exactly do you need to uh categorize but
12:18 you answered that cuz like if the cell
12:20 is uh has cancer right then you don't
12:23 want that cell.
12:24 Yes. And the main like they wanted to
12:26 prevent metastasis of cancer into like
12:29 another tissue.
12:31 Mhm.
12:32 Yeah, that does sound very impactful and
12:35 for you as a student was uh like working
12:38 on the things like that. Yeah, I can see
12:41 why it was very interesting and uh like
12:44 you worked on this master thesis and
12:46 then the company
12:48 you did some models, right? And then
12:51 Mhm.
12:52 the company
12:55 integrated this right in their
12:58 sorting mechanism.
13:01 Yeah, that's pretty cool.
13:03 Mhm. So, you really like this topic and
13:04 then you started researching okay what
13:08 where can I go next and then you found
13:10 Philips Healthcare right?
13:13 Yeah. And there I worked
13:16 um on a topic that it was not really
13:19 related to data science.
13:22 uh but they have this uh seat C arm
13:27 which is like on the shape of seats like
13:29 that and on the top of this arm there
13:31 are four cameras
13:34 uh and here it's like the bed of the
13:36 patient and those four cameras take like
13:40 a different perspective of the patient
13:42 and they have also a different angle and
13:45 like my task there was to uh take those
13:49 four images calculate the geometry and
13:52 create the 3D object representation of
13:54 the patient.
13:57 Well, it still sounds very mathematical
13:59 heavy, right?
14:02 It was very mathematical heavy, but it's
14:04 not like machine learning those things.
14:06 But it was Yes.
14:08 Do you know if this problem is being
14:11 solved these days with machine learning
14:13 with neural nets?
14:17 I'm not aware about this
14:19 cuz I saw like it's not related to
14:21 healthcare at all. I saw
14:24 some demos where people were going
14:26 around Berlin or other different cities
14:28 taking pictures and then there is a
14:30 model or something
14:33 uh that just takes all these images and
14:35 creates like a 3D model of these things
14:39 and it looked really impressive
14:43 like what they could do with just a few
14:45 images. I'm sure that probably machine
14:47 learning can help on like the challenges
14:50 of these computational methods
14:53 because for example sometimes uh we had
14:56 occlusions
14:58 uh which means that um
15:01 when there was no object between the
15:04 cameras it was easy to reconstruct the
15:06 3D object but when we had like a
15:08 surgical object it was harder to like
15:13 create the shape of the 3D
15:16 So this computational method was not
15:18 really um yes tackling this challenge or
15:21 probably machine learning can create a
15:23 better like graphical model.
15:26 Mhm.
15:27 Okay. But it was still quite
15:29 mathematical heavy and then eventually
15:31 you after working on this uh 3D
15:34 reconstruction you probably continued
15:38 working in this data science areas
15:40 right?
15:40 Mhm.
15:41 Also in Philips.
15:42 Mhm. I worked as a data analyst after
15:46 uh on a project that was a research
15:48 project
15:50 again because I mainly work in research
15:52 all those years and we were actually
15:56 collecting data from preian woman
15:59 um and that project was directed
16:03 um
16:05 like the users were midwives
16:08 that they wanted to see how the pregnant
16:10 woman are doing at home. So it was home
16:13 care and the pregnant woman were waiting
16:17 themselves every day. They were wearing
16:19 a smart watch that was calculating their
16:21 heart rate. Um
16:24 and actually this was important
16:26 information for the midwives because
16:28 also it's very important during the
16:30 pregnancy uh how many weight the
16:34 pregnant woman are gaining because it
16:36 needs to be within some limits.
16:39 uh and I was working uh as a data
16:43 analyst there on developing a dashboard
16:46 visualizing in a user friendly way this
16:48 information for the midwives. But we
16:50 were actually co-creating this because
16:52 we were getting a lot of feedback from
16:54 them on what is like useful for them to
16:58 see and what is like not. So that was
17:01 quite interesting because um it was also
17:06 like I really like that I was getting
17:08 the feedback from them and then we were
17:10 creating it together.
17:14 Oh I'm trying to look at what we
17:17 discussed so far.
17:19 Yes. And uh like you worked well first
17:24 like your thesis was about um the cell
17:27 classification
17:28 for cell sortter then you worked at this
17:32 with this 3D reconstruction
17:34 then um the thing you just described um
17:38 so it was more like not for an
17:40 operational room not for like a hospital
17:42 but uh something you wear at home for
17:44 pregnant pregnant women and then I'm
17:47 wondering like is there like these areas
17:49 Yes, they look quite different from one
17:52 from from each other, right? So they're
17:54 they're different. So I'm wondering if
17:56 there is any area of healthcare that
17:59 you're more interested in or they're all
18:01 equally interesting for you.
18:03 Mhm.
18:05 as you said they're quite different with
18:06 each other and also like if you consider
18:08 the projects I worked later on they're
18:11 also quite different
18:15 but uh they have a common thing that the
18:19 approach or the things that you are
18:21 looking at when you are working with
18:24 healthcare data
18:28 but personally what I find interesting
18:31 is to work on the research side of
18:33 healthcare
18:34 because I like the novelty of create and
18:37 also creating new ideas. And
18:42 another common thing is that I find
18:44 interesting to work on projects that
18:48 they also have the potential of a
18:51 clinical application or that they're
18:53 already like uh tested in a real
18:56 setting.
18:59 So there is no specific area. you more
19:02 focus on like can I make impact now
19:04 right
19:05 can I publish a paper or will the thing
19:08 I work on will go and affect lives now
19:11 after I finish
19:13 okay it must be really cool to see
19:14 things you work on in action right
19:17 mhm yes that uh that is quite rewarding
19:22 I
19:22 think you published a few papers
19:23 research papers right
19:26 uh what were these papers
19:28 so during um uh the period that I was
19:34 working for this company that we were
19:37 working for like vital sign monitoring
19:39 systems in Africa.
19:43 I was working on
19:48 um it's called balistography signal
19:51 data. So
19:54 it's actually
19:58 a novel uh signal. I'm thinking on how
20:01 to explain that easier for people. Uh
20:04 and it's actually this signal and this
20:07 application wants to replace the
20:11 electroc cardiography signal. Uh and
20:15 like in simple terms now if a patient is
20:19 in the intensive care unit they just put
20:22 the electrodes on the patient and they
20:25 need to like have the electrodes there
20:27 for many hours and it can be tiring for
20:30 the patient and the patient cannot move
20:31 around. H while this sensor was actually
20:38 a mat that was going uh below the like
20:41 actual mat of the patient's bed and was
20:44 recording the signal of the movement
20:47 including like the movement that comes
20:50 from the respiration rate and the heart
20:52 rate.
20:54 So I was actually working on that. I was
20:56 using uh the ballistography signal and
21:00 the electroc cardiography signal uh as a
21:03 reference and then I was trying to
21:07 remove the noise from the bistography
21:09 signal and extract the vitals from
21:11 there. So that was the novel
21:14 application.
21:16 So if I understood correctly
21:18 uh so in this method u so there there is
21:21 one uh more like not intrusive but
21:24 annoying not convenient method when the
21:27 patient is covered with all these uh
21:30 electrodes right it's not convenient and
21:32 then there's less annoying method which
21:34 is like just placing something under the
21:36 mat where the patient is right
21:39 and what you were doing is trying to use
21:42 machine learning to go from the signal
21:45 like more noisy signal to more accurate
21:47 signal.
21:49 Yes, that's
21:50 have an estimation of the heart rate and
21:52 respiration rate.
21:53 For the respiration rate, I used more
21:57 conventional signal processing appro
22:00 approaches because it's simpler to
22:02 estimate the respiration rate which is
22:04 like much bigger signal what you get.
22:06 But then for the heart rate, it was much
22:08 more challenging and that's why we went
22:11 into deep learning. And we also like I
22:14 had I have the approach that if we can
22:16 use like if we can solve a problem with
22:18 basic signal processing then it's much
22:20 better to do it like that and if we need
22:23 to use something like more advanced then
22:26 we can go to deep learning machine
22:28 learning techniques
22:30 and what is basic signal processing it's
22:32 like this FIA methods something like
22:34 that
22:34 yes so filters FIA methods yes
22:40 yeah I focusing on H frequencies of the
22:44 respiration rate that we were interested
22:46 in.
22:46 However, there of course there were some
22:48 challenges because we had to do with
22:51 pediatric patients which means weaker
22:53 signals like class movement
22:57 and we also had the challenge that
23:00 sometimes the frequencies of the
23:01 respiration rate and the heart rate can
23:03 overlap
23:06 and then it's like hard to know what is
23:09 what. But yeah, it's a it's it's a very
23:12 interesting research. I
23:15 I see that you shared a link to one of
23:19 your publications which is
23:21 a unit deep learning model for infant
23:24 heart rate estimation from
23:27 ballistography, right? That's the paper
23:30 you're talking about.
23:32 Yeah. And this is the paper where we
23:34 were estimating the heart rate. uh we
23:37 use this UNET which is actually used for
23:41 object segmentation.
23:44 Uh but we use it for the object
23:46 segmentation in images but in this case
23:48 we use it for the signal because there
23:51 is um in the balltography signal there
23:53 is a very distinct uh pattern of the
23:57 heart rate and actually our focus was to
24:00 identify this distinct pattern on the
24:03 signal.
24:05 Yeah, quite interesting. So, I'm just
24:08 looking at the paper. Well, not at the
24:10 actual paper and more at like at this
24:12 research gate website. We will
24:14 definitely put the link in the
24:15 description so you can
24:17 check it out.
24:18 Um,
24:20 yeah, a lot of words I don't understand
24:22 like BSG waveform
24:26 probably. It's a quite an interesting uh
24:28 read. Okay, thanks.
24:31 Um and I I think like when you probably
24:35 you wanted to talk about some other
24:37 papers right or some other research
24:40 before we the next one.
24:43 This is like my my first publication
24:47 but
24:48 I also like uh I published a poster
24:53 that it's not like available online
24:56 [Music]
24:58 but it was about uh calculating a
25:02 patient scoring based on the vitals of
25:05 the patients and the main idea behind
25:08 this was to have like an overall
25:11 assessment of the health status of the
25:13 patient so that like health care
25:15 professionals can have an idea of like
25:17 how uh critical is this patient.
25:21 Yeah.
25:23 Yeah. And I I already see quite a few
25:26 questions and this is actually one of
25:27 the questions uh we also have
25:31 is about the challenges of working
25:34 um in healthcare cuz it's a quite
25:38 regulated um area right and uh like I
25:44 guess there are a lot of privacy
25:45 concerns and things like that. So what
25:47 are the typical challenges of working
25:50 there?
25:53 Uh yes, one it's like uh getting
25:57 regulatory approval for including
25:59 algorithms and machine learning
26:01 algorithms in the devices and the reason
26:04 behind that is that it's like a black
26:07 box. So of course it's sometimes hard to
26:13 like understand why a machine learning
26:15 model predict a specific outcome.
26:19 Um
26:21 yeah and there there a lot of work needs
26:24 to be done in the like explainable AI
26:27 part on like um how we can give an
26:32 explanation on why the algorithm
26:34 predicted a specific outcome which like
26:37 this field of AI it's still in a very
26:39 early stage. So I think the more this
26:42 field will be developed also the more
26:44 trust will be like um from the side of
26:47 the health care professionals but also
26:49 from the people that uh approve such a
26:53 devices to be used in hospitals.
26:59 Yeah. one this is it. Another is the
27:04 lack of data sometimes or lack of
27:07 consistent data that
27:11 in real data sets we see a lot of times
27:13 that there are many data gaps. So this
27:16 makes it hard for the algorithms to take
27:20 properly the inputs and sometimes we
27:23 need to make assumptions on what kind of
27:26 data we would expect to that patient but
27:29 then still this is also not always the
27:32 way to go. So that's a problem and
27:36 another big problem is that many times
27:38 the data is being collected without
27:40 having in mind what kind of um a use uh
27:45 like this organization wants to do with
27:47 this. So for example, one common problem
27:50 is lack of annotations
27:52 and then like for example they say we
27:55 want to do a predictive algorithm for a
27:57 specific clinical outcome but then the
28:00 proper data annotations for this outcome
28:03 are not there.
28:07 What kind of outcomes is it like is a
28:09 patient going to have a stroke? Things
28:11 like that.
28:12 Yeah. And like in my previous research,
28:15 I was working on estimating sepsis,
28:18 let's say.
28:19 Mhm.
28:20 Based on the vital signs of the patient
28:22 and also the clinical data.
28:26 I don't know if I want to Google what
28:27 sepsis is.
28:31 It's extreme respon. Sepsis is the
28:33 body's extreme response to an infection.
28:36 It is a life-threatening medical
28:38 emergency. So I guess you want to um
28:42 understand you want to predict that this
28:43 thing is about to happen. So you want to
28:46 act as fast as possible, right?
28:49 Because the fastest you act on that the
28:51 more like chances you have to treat it.
28:54 Mhm.
28:56 And uh that's I guess why this
28:58 explainable AI is very important cuz
29:01 like if the algorithm predicts hey this
29:04 patient is going to have sepsis, right?
29:06 And then doctor looks at the patient and
29:07 thinks like okay like they look normal
29:10 right? Mhm.
29:10 So then they need to understand why
29:12 exactly the algorithm this model thinks
29:15 that there's a problem right and maybe
29:18 if the doctor understands then yeah okay
29:21 yeah now makes sense let's make a few
29:23 checks right
29:25 and what I think about this topic is
29:27 that the approach that should be taken
29:29 like um for the algorithms needs to be
29:33 like as a tool for uh the decision
29:37 making the algorithms are not like now
29:39 in a level to to the decision making and
29:42 that's why we need to be careful with
29:44 that. It's just a tool to help the
29:46 doctors um assess a situation
29:50 because also what I see
29:52 people tend to really go far ahead and
29:54 we say we want to predict what the
29:56 patients we have we want to give advice
29:58 on what the doctors should do but I
30:00 think h the more datadriven approach
30:03 needs to be integrated slowly into the
30:06 hospital settings by just in the
30:08 beginning giving some recommendations or
30:10 even say ah maybe there's 60% chance
30:13 that this patient might have this kind
30:16 of disease. So to make the doctors aware
30:19 that this is not a certainty, they just
30:22 need to look more on that.
30:24 Mhm. So it's more like to get to gain
30:26 trust from from the doctors from the
30:29 medical personnel uh personnel that they
30:32 see okay like this model is actually
30:35 making our life simpler now we trust it
30:38 and then it could be integrated in their
30:40 workflow more and more right
30:43 or also um what I think is that
30:46 sometimes even just data visualizations
30:49 of like uh with historical data of what
30:52 happened to similar patients in the past
30:55 can be already helpful without any
30:57 prediction. Mhm.
30:59 So and then this is like more data
31:01 science and not machine learning just
31:02 like making doctors more aware of like
31:05 what happened in the past
31:09 and you talked about this regulatory
31:13 approvals
31:15 and I imagine that these things make it
31:18 very difficult
31:20 to like let's say you work on a thesis
31:23 or like you work on a model and then now
31:25 it's time to actually what we call like
31:28 ship this model to production and this
31:30 process of
31:32 actually bringing this model and
31:34 algorithm from research to production
31:36 could be quite challenging right so I
31:40 think it's there is also a question from
31:41 David like how difficult is to come up
31:44 with a solution that is actually used in
31:46 the field like there are some political
31:48 barriers that might appear along the way
31:52 like how how how difficult and how do
31:56 you usually solve these problems
32:00 Um
32:01 what we were doing is that we were
32:03 getting a lot of feedback from the
32:04 health care professionals on what they
32:06 need like from the doctors from the
32:08 nurses because they were also like
32:12 they're like using the vital sign
32:14 monitoring system.
32:17 M but indeed the regulatory approval
32:20 part is a very big challenge
32:24 and there there are also other people
32:27 involved the experts on that. So asking
32:30 those people what's the way to go it's
32:33 like it can be helpful for bringing
32:36 those things into production
32:39 because many times we have the
32:41 application
32:43 uh but yeah it stucks
32:46 and it cannot like it might take five
32:48 years to like be used in a hospital
32:53 I think
32:56 so I guess in this case what you want is
32:58 uh doctors is also actively advocating
33:00 on your behalf saying that okay look
33:03 like this thing is really useful uh we
33:06 want to have it right and that's what
33:08 you said uh like you said you want to
33:10 get feedback from this healthcare
33:13 professionals
33:14 cuz like if the feedback is positive
33:16 they clearly see the value in this thing
33:18 then they help you right
33:20 yeah and then they trust it also more
33:23 because there is also lack of trust or
33:25 some sometimes there is also this
33:28 approach to people that they don't want
33:29 to try something new. They say, "Ah, no,
33:32 we work with these." They don't want to
33:34 change.
33:36 Mhm.
33:38 So, you need to find doctors or health
33:41 care professionals who are a little more
33:44 open-minded than
33:46 others, right?
33:47 Mhm.
33:48 Could be difficult. Yeah.
33:51 Yeah.
33:53 So, yeah, I see that there's a comment
33:56 from Sylvia. Thanks Eleni for sharing
33:59 your experience. How advanced and
34:01 trusted is data science in healthcare
34:04 compared to other sectors? Cuz for
34:06 example I work in e-commerce and e in
34:08 e-commerce people already know that okay
34:10 it's like
34:12 we have to have like a recommended
34:14 system like it's a default right so then
34:16 there is automatically distrust that we
34:18 know that machine learning and data
34:19 science will help e-commerce so let's
34:21 use it right so there are usually no
34:23 questions asked but in healthcare as you
34:26 said like people are not willing to try
34:28 new things then like it's not always
34:31 clear what exactly it brings and then
34:33 like there's also
34:36 regulator regulatory approvals might be
34:39 difficult. So I imagine that maybe
34:41 there's less like data science there is
34:44 less advanced than in other areas. Is it
34:47 correct assumption?
34:48 It's true. And there is also something
34:50 else uh like you said you work in
34:52 e-commerce and everything is digital
34:54 there. So you can have a lot of data.
34:56 You can track what customers are doing.
34:58 And in the hospitals it's not like this
35:01 because sometimes you have data but you
35:04 don't have the time stamp of when this
35:06 happened or you have a time stamp that
35:08 might be wrong
35:10 and then you need to assume like that
35:12 this happened around this time. So there
35:15 are a lot of things that happening
35:16 offline
35:18 which makes the data less like accurate
35:22 and like from there from the beginning
35:25 that's already a difficulty and of
35:28 course second thing is that the impact
35:31 of like a prediction it can be it's much
35:36 bigger than like maybe client gets um
35:38 like a wrong recommendation. What's the
35:40 worst thing can happen?
35:44 It was like they would not just buy
35:46 thing right and then they will continue
35:49 living their own life
35:51 while here actually like sometimes can
35:53 be a matter of uh living and dying
35:56 right.
35:57 Mhm.
36:00 Yeah. How do you see this evolve like do
36:02 you think it will get more trust in the
36:05 future? I think
36:06 other successful use cases stories
36:10 [Music]
36:11 there is a lot of research and
36:13 investment on that and I think that
36:17 already means that the algorithm will
36:18 become better because okay there is a
36:22 reason also why there is not trust it's
36:24 not that this field is really evolved
36:26 and that always the predictions are to
36:29 be trust
36:31 so but then because there is a lot of
36:33 research
36:35 And
36:37 also that means that um we have data
36:40 from different populations because
36:42 that's also a problem that maybe like uh
36:46 what I noticed also with my previous
36:48 working experience
36:50 is that we were collecting data from
36:51 Africa that there is not a lot of data
36:53 for Africa and we cannot use an
36:55 algorithm that we develop in Europe with
36:57 European patients for African patients.
37:00 So I think uh like with time we will
37:04 have data from different populations and
37:06 then the algorithms will become better
37:10 in that
37:11 uh yes so I see there is a lot of
37:14 potential that's why I'm also motivated
37:16 to contribute on that
37:20 but I think this like even if AI or like
37:24 now generative AI is really advanced
37:29 AI it's not really advanced in all the
37:31 fields in society and still there are
37:33 fields that they need a lot of um work
37:36 to be done.
37:39 Yeah. And one of the points you
37:41 mentioned that you can just easily take
37:43 data collected in Europe and use it for
37:45 Africa which makes sense but also a bit
37:48 uh not exactly intuitive at the first
37:52 like when I first think about this cuz
37:54 on one hand people is people everywhere
37:57 right? But then like probably the living
37:59 conditions are different u like climate
38:02 is different. So so why can't we just
38:05 take data from Europe and use it for
38:06 Africa? What are the reasons?
38:09 Like one thing is that in Africa there
38:11 are more malaria patients for example
38:14 than in Europe. So what I want to say
38:17 with that there are also sometimes
38:18 different diseases in people
38:21 based on the location they live and
38:26 that's why it's important to take those
38:28 things into account or also like in
38:30 different settings
38:32 maybe in Europe it's easier to collect
38:35 data from every single thing of the
38:37 patient but in in Africa this is not
38:39 possible so you have limited data
38:41 collected and you need to take a
38:43 decision on that. Mhm.
38:47 And I imagine that a person like an
38:50 average person who lives in Norwegia in
38:53 Norway like they're probably very
38:56 different from an average person living
38:58 in uh um I don't know Nigeria.
39:03 Mhm. Yeah. They have different
39:05 lifestyles, different
39:09 Yeah. Interesting. But uh still like is
39:11 data European data not useful at all?
39:18 We need to be careful when we do these
39:20 kind of things.
39:23 But it can be useful also maybe for
39:27 having some conclusions for us but not
39:30 for developing really an algorithm to
39:33 applying law or settings.
39:36 Mhm. Okay. So you need to think okay
39:38 like for this specific I don't know
39:39 feature or data set like uh are there
39:43 any problems that might like is there
39:46 something that makes I don't know the
39:50 way the data was collected in Europe
39:51 different from the data was collected in
39:53 Africa like can we actually use it right
39:55 so for each specific case you need to
39:57 think right
40:00 um and while we were talking about um
40:05 integrating the solutions the algorithms
40:07 bringing them from research to
40:09 production. Um so there's some push back
40:12 from people who don't want to try new
40:14 things
40:15 and I remember like even in the in
40:18 e-commerce settings. Um so I was working
40:21 with moderation teams in the past and
40:24 there was some moderators they were
40:26 thinking okay like so now these data
40:29 scientists come and they create machine
40:32 learning models like this AI will
40:34 automate our jobs and we will become
40:37 redundant so let's not help them right
40:40 well I'm not saying that people were
40:42 explicitly saying that there but like I
40:45 sense this sentiment and for me as a
40:47 data scientist my job was to also
40:49 educate them say hey we are not going to
40:52 make you redundant we are not going to
40:53 fire you we actually want to help you be
40:56 more effective
40:58 and I wonder like is there something
41:00 similar that you see in healthcare like
41:03 is there
41:05 maybe this lack of trust coming from
41:08 these health care professionals is
41:10 because they think okay now my job will
41:12 be automated like there will be the
41:14 sensors that monitor the patient's
41:16 condition and why Am I needed there?
41:19 Like I'm not needed anymore. So I will
41:21 not try to help you cuz like why will I
41:24 help you make myself redundant?
41:28 I have not seen it because
41:32 they still have a lot of impact in the
41:36 decision making and those algorithms are
41:38 not too far ahead.
41:41 So for now I think maybe they don't feel
41:44 that their job is at risk.
41:47 H maybe in the further further future
41:50 but for now I have not seen something
41:52 like that but what I personally believe
41:54 is that like by the years that AI will
41:58 become more developed uh this is an
42:01 actual risk because it already happens
42:03 for example with some jobs like like now
42:07 in the Netherlands in many supermarkets
42:09 they had like the uh automatic cashier
42:13 machine and before people were working
42:15 there and now just one version observes
42:18 if everything goes all right. So and
42:21 this is like a simple automation but
42:24 then yes in the future also more complex
42:29 uh decision making processes can replace
42:32 humans
42:34 but okay I know like the viewpoints on
42:36 this topic are
42:39 controversial sometimes. Yeah,
42:42 I mean maybe the cashiers who worked and
42:46 were replaced by the machines now they
42:48 can do something else in the same store
42:50 so they don't need to do this monotonous
42:53 work every day. Maybe it's actually a
42:55 good thing but we don't know what
42:57 happened with licers, right?
43:01 Yeah.
43:04 But let's see. I'm also curious how this
43:06 thing is going to be developed.
43:08 Mhm.
43:10 Yeah. I see that there is a comment
43:12 about India that in smaller cities data
43:16 uh is not created properly especially in
43:18 healthcare and uh yeah even in Germany
43:22 like it's such a mess to be honest like
43:26 Germany is a pretty advanced country but
43:28 when it comes to healthcare like it's so
43:31 decentralized like all the like diff
43:34 different uh doctor offices like have
43:37 their own methods of collecting data and
43:39 yeah It's it's quite messy.
43:42 Mhm.
43:45 Yes, this is true.
43:48 But I think there is a lot of work that
43:50 is being done on organizing like the
43:52 systems and also I think the healthcare
43:54 system in the Netherlands. Um when I
43:57 came to the Netherlands it was much less
43:59 organized and now they have like uh
44:03 patient files and they can just send
44:07 your electronic file to another hospital
44:11 and when I initially came those things
44:14 were less uh automatic and less
44:18 connected. So
44:21 yes, there are people that they are
44:23 working on standardizing like the
44:25 systems that the data is going like also
44:28 to be saved because that's also another
44:29 thing that sometimes data is not
44:31 properly saved in secure places
44:36 but yeah
44:38 yeah I think in general the Netherlands
44:40 is pretty uh is a pretty advanced
44:44 country in many aspects not just
44:46 healthcare and the way data is collected
44:48 cuz like In Germany, people still send
44:50 foxes. Like, I don't know.
44:53 I recently did an MRI explanation and
44:58 all I got was a compact disc. I don't
45:00 know. Like, I don't even have like
45:02 places where I can put a compact disc
45:04 anymore.
45:05 Yeah. So, yes. Well, at least it wasn't
45:08 like a discat or whatever. Could be a
45:11 discat, right? Too. Mhm. And maybe I
45:15 also see big differences because I see
45:17 that healthcare in Greece for example is
45:19 also like different than in the
45:22 Netherlands. They don't have this like
45:24 digitalization that they have here.
45:27 They also give compact discs sometimes.
45:31 Okay. Yeah. Well, from what I heard
45:34 about the Netherlands, like uh it is
45:37 doing a really amazing job when it comes
45:39 to all this dig digitization of
45:42 things.
45:44 Yeah. Do you think that like coming back
45:47 to the trust topic? M so I imagine that
45:51 uh most of these healthcare problems
45:53 like I don't know cell classification
45:54 and I don't know like um the thing you
45:58 were talking about predicting from like
45:59 quick signal predicting like always u um
46:03 body vitals
46:05 um like I imagine that it's since we
46:08 know that machine learning is not always
46:10 accurate I imagine that in many cases
46:13 like it's not as 100%
46:16 accurate prediction so it can be like
46:18 80% 70% % like does it make it more
46:21 difficult like do we see do we have to
46:23 like have really accurate systems to use
46:26 them or like if it's already like 60%
46:28 accurate it's already good
46:31 I think the case is that it's not very
46:33 accurate we need to give more
46:35 information to the people so that they
46:37 can take decisions like we can what I
46:39 said before say we have 60% accuracy
46:43 so then the person knows that
46:47 this is just an estimation and it's not
46:50 really what's the reality. So they need
46:51 to check by themselves or they need to
46:54 like see that and say okay we will do
46:56 this extra lab test because of that. So
46:59 at the end it's not a tool that says
47:03 what happens in reality but it's more
47:05 like a notification like oh maybe this
47:09 patient has this or even
47:12 if we want to make them
47:15 like to make systems that they don't say
47:18 ah this patient has this critical
47:19 outcome. It can be that you say this
47:22 patient has a high risk factor which is
47:24 more in generic.
47:27 So there are different things and
47:29 different ways you can phrase and you
47:31 can give estimations about the situation
47:33 of the patient and what I think is that
47:36 we need to build this um this thing
47:40 gradually.
47:41 So maybe first just give a description
47:44 of the data of the patient in a more
47:47 like in a better visualization because
47:50 data visualization is also a part of
47:52 this. So that the health care
47:54 professional can understand the current
47:56 status. Then okay if you develop like
47:59 mathematical model then you can say ah
48:02 there is this patient has a bit higher
48:04 risk just look at this space
48:08 and maybe like with time also those
48:10 algorithms as I said they will be
48:11 developed more and they will be more
48:14 accurate.
48:15 Mhm. Plus
48:18 I think for the algorithm to be
48:20 developed and to be more accurate we
48:22 need feedback from the health care
48:24 professionals. So if they like there is
48:26 a prediction then they can say uh this
48:29 was a good prediction this was a bad
48:31 prediction and the reasons
48:33 so that the algorithm can take this
48:35 feedback and improve.
48:38 Mhm. So it all comes back to topics we
48:41 already to things we already talked
48:43 about like getting feedback from health
48:45 care professionals and then investing
48:47 into better data collection processes,
48:49 right?
48:49 But more feedback on the prediction. So
48:52 like have the prediction and then
48:54 respond on that. But what I see this is
48:57 a kind of um um a cyclical process.
49:03 So it's not that I have the algorithms
49:05 will be ready and they will be used like
49:07 in a linear way. It's more about
49:09 cycllically
49:12 like making more and more accurate
49:13 predictions.
49:15 But I think for me it's important to be
49:17 as much as possible transparent.
49:20 Mhm.
49:20 And give information to the people.
49:24 Okay.
49:24 And don't make big claims about things.
49:28 Okay. It's not like uh yeah this patient
49:32 definitely has um
49:35 sepsis right so instead like this is a
49:38 high-risisk patient please check them
49:40 right and then the doctor makes
49:42 explanation and says okay indeed this
49:44 was a high-risisk case so then you get
49:47 this feedback and you try to incorporate
49:49 this feedback into like collect this and
49:53 add this to your data right
49:57 and uh there is a question from Ain
50:00 about uh data engineering and data
50:02 science which made me think like okay we
50:06 talked about the data science part but
50:08 there is also
50:11 like for example I'm again thinking
50:13 about the commercial settings so like
50:15 there is a data scientist who develops a
50:18 machine learning algorithm like a model
50:20 right and then there is typically a
50:22 machine learning engineer who takes this
50:23 model and
50:26 takes care of all the engineering around
50:28 the model. Um is there something like
50:31 that like how does exactly
50:34 you go about deploying this thing
50:36 provided that all these bureaucratic
50:38 things are solved like I imagine it's
50:41 not like you just take this ple file and
50:43 put this on the device there is a
50:45 process and there's a lot of engineering
50:46 involved there too
50:48 right
50:50 but then this is indeed it's like for
50:52 the data engineer to just take the model
50:54 that the data science scientist created
50:57 it and then deploy deploy that on the
51:00 machine so that it also works and aligns
51:02 with the rest of the software there.
51:07 And also they're taking into account h
51:10 the restrictions of that because for
51:14 example in the low research setting
51:16 sometimes uh you cannot for example have
51:19 the model on the cloud. It's not a good
51:21 idea because there is no internet there
51:23 is not a lot of
51:25 like always
51:27 uh connectivity. So then you need to
51:29 deploy the model on the device itself.
51:32 So
51:35 yes, you need to take into account the
51:37 specific use case that you deploy the
51:39 model.
51:41 Yeah,
51:42 for this unit that we talked about u was
51:46 it on device or in the cloud?
51:50 H so this unit it was more on the
51:53 research phase.
51:54 Uhhuh.
51:55 um and
51:58 we wanted to validate it further. So it
52:01 was on that phase.
52:02 Yes. Things don't go very fast. We need
52:04 to keep
52:05 Yeah. Okay. Okay. So it was more about
52:08 like okay we have this data we applied
52:10 the model research looks promising let's
52:13 continue rather than okay like we
52:15 already deployed and and it's working
52:18 and the continuation is also the
52:20 validation of this. So
52:23 before deploying it uh validating with
52:26 new data
52:28 h and checking whether it works or not
52:31 and like what's the accuracy of it.
52:34 So there are many steps on it.
52:37 Yeah. And regulatory approval it's also
52:39 a big one
52:40 like it takes more time.
52:45 So you mentioned that you're having a
52:47 sabbatical at the moment. Mhm.
52:49 Um, are you working on some
52:53 personal projects that are related to
52:54 healthcare too?
52:56 I'm working on some personal projects
52:59 and I'm also doing some traveling and
53:01 I'm having some plans also for the next
53:03 months
53:05 and I'm actually reflecting on like what
53:08 I'm going to do next and like taking a
53:12 break to like rejuvenate.
53:15 Yeah.
53:16 Is there something you can already tell
53:18 us about or we will need to wait till
53:20 the next interview?
53:23 You will need to wait.
53:25 Okay. Okay. We will keep an eye on your
53:27 LinkedIn profile.
53:29 Mhm.
53:30 Yeah.
53:30 Okay. If somebody wants to get into
53:34 healthcare and like somebody is a data
53:36 scientist,
53:38 what's uh how would you recommend them
53:40 to to do that? So let's say I'm a data
53:43 scientist. I have this typical
53:44 e-commerce experience but I got so
53:46 motivated after listening to you right
53:48 now and I think I want to to do
53:50 something. So how can I get started? How
53:54 can I start using my skills for that?
54:00 I think first it's like more getting
54:04 um
54:06 a general idea on like do you want to
54:08 focus on research? Do you want to focus
54:10 and to apply for a company that they
54:12 already like u have already people
54:16 working on the regulatory approval and
54:18 then you can already work on deploying
54:20 those models in actual devices that they
54:23 are being sold and yeah it depends it
54:27 starts from you and what you want but
54:31 from my experience because I I had like
54:33 the technical background and I'm working
54:35 in a different healthcare projects when
54:38 I started the project I I learn a lot of
54:41 clinical information. So in the
54:44 beginning because also it's healthcare
54:46 field is different. I have a lot of
54:47 unknown like conditions are known words
54:50 like also sepsis for me as it was for
54:52 you it was unknown but then after a
54:54 while
54:56 it becomes one word of my vocabulary. So
54:59 it's like if you have the technical
55:01 knowledge then you get also the context
55:03 by like spending two months on the
55:07 setting.
55:09 Mhm.
55:09 Yeah.
55:11 So what you said it's about you and what
55:12 I want but is it enough for me to just
55:15 want to work in healthcare or I also
55:18 need to have to get some prior knowledge
55:21 to be able to do that. So with
55:24 my typical data science data scientist
55:27 who has experience working at the at an
55:30 internet company they have no idea what
55:32 sepsis is as me
55:35 like they can just apply start applying
55:37 cuz the skills they have are already
55:40 enough or there should be some
55:41 preparation
55:43 before that.
55:46 I think the skills are already enough
55:49 and maybe they will get a more technical
55:51 job in the beginning in a healthcare
55:54 company and then they can shift more if
55:58 they want. That's what I saw for example
56:01 in Philips healthcare
56:02 that people entering the company and
56:05 then they were finding their way.
56:08 Mhm. Okay. So the important thing is as
56:10 you said what you want right? if you
56:12 already have the skills then you can
56:14 just apply and learn along the way
56:20 in general. So I imagine that uh there
56:24 are many
56:27 like it's not the easiest job to have
56:29 because of all the problems all the
56:31 difficulties we discussed. So does it
56:35 turn like what I what I what I try to
56:39 ask is like is there a lack of people
56:41 who want to work in healthcare or there
56:44 is usually a lot of interest from from
56:47 candidates from like I don't know data
56:49 scientists
56:50 I think there is a lot of interest but
56:52 they also ask for a lot of people in
56:54 general in the field of data science so
56:58 that's what I have seen but okay it
57:00 depends also on the country but still uh
57:04 but like for example in the Netherlands
57:06 uh there are like plenty of options
57:12 but indeed plenty of data scientists as
57:15 well because what I have noticed with
57:17 many people they like they sift to that
57:21 domain there is like a trend.
57:25 Mhm. Okay. Yeah.
57:26 Well, it's great that there is uh u
57:30 funding. So then there are companies who
57:33 can pay money and then there are data
57:35 scientists who are interested in working
57:37 on this. So they can you know find each
57:39 other and actually you know make
57:42 something work on something meaningful
57:44 while not starving right while making
57:47 enough money to live. That's really
57:48 good. And especially in the healthcare
57:50 domain, there are still a lot of fields
57:52 that um they haven't included a lot of
57:56 data science yet. They use like
57:58 statistics, they use linear regression
58:00 models. So yes, and there is already
58:03 funding. So they need a lot of people to
58:07 work on that.
58:09 And why I mentioned about starving
58:11 because I remember talking to somebody
58:15 and they said it was like a few years
58:18 ago that sometimes these projects are
58:21 not really well funded. So it's like
58:23 really people who who want to make the
58:26 change
58:28 um but they have to be like very
58:30 enthusiastic about this right. So it's
58:34 um compared to working in an internet
58:36 company
58:38 that sometimes you know pays less right.
58:41 So people need to be really
58:43 you know uh you know willing to to do
58:47 this work. I hope this has changed.
58:51 I have not seen this but maybe it
58:53 depends also on the country
58:55 because in different countries there are
58:57 different funds as well.
58:58 So the Netherlands is pretty advanced as
59:00 we discussed.
59:02 probably it's not an issue there. Okay,
59:04 it's all we have time for today. Thanks
59:06 a lot, Elena, for joining us today, for
59:09 sharing your experience with us. It was
59:13 really interesting to listen to your
59:15 stories and everything you said and
59:18 thanks everyone else for joining us
59:19 today and listening in and asking
59:22 questions.
59:24 Thanks as well for inviting me. It's
59:26 also was nice to talk to you.
59:28 Likewise. And thanks again Adonis for
59:31 introducing Helena and me.
59:35 So yeah, well looking forward to seeing
59:38 what happens after your subatical. So
59:41 I'll keep an eye and good luck with
59:42 everything.
59:43 Thank you.
59:44 Yeah. Okay. Bye and have a great weekend
59:47 everyone.
59:48 Bye.
59:48 Bye. Great week. Not weekend. Yeah. that
59:51 we
