One repository for some of the workshops I'm giving

## Workshops

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning

- **[mlzoomcamp-deep-learning](mlzoomcamp-deep-learning/)** - Deep Learning with PyTorch workshop covering image classification, transfer learning, and model deployment. Learn to build CNNs using PyTorch instead of TensorFlow/Keras.

- **[mlzoomcamp-fastapi-uv](mlzoomcamp-fastapi-uv/)** - Deploying ML models with FastAPI and uv. Modern approach to ML deployment using Scikit-Learn pipelines, FastAPI instead of Flask, and uv for dependency management.

- **[mlzoomcamp-serverless](mlzoomcamp-serverless/)** - Machine Learning and Deep Learning model deployment with Serverless. Deploy Scikit-Learn and deep learning models using AWS Lambda, Docker, and ONNX.

- **[mlzoomcamp-k8s](mlzoomcamp-k8s/)** - Model deployment with Kubernetes and ONNX. Deploy ML models using Kubernetes with Kind, including autoscaling with HPA and health checks.

### AI Agents & RAG

- **[agents-mcp](agents-mcp/)** - Agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol) workshop. Deep dive into function calling, OpenAI Agents SDK, PydanticAI, and building MCP servers for agents.

- **[coding-agent](coding-agent/)** - Create a coding agent that generates Django applications from a single prompt. Build an agent with file operations, bash commands, and AI-powered code generation.

- **[agent-skills](agent-skills/)** - Coding agent with skills and commands. Extend your coding agent with modular capabilities and user-facing shortcuts inspired by Claude Code.

- **[rag-evaluations](rag-evaluations/)** - RAG evaluations workshop covering how to evaluate RAG systems and Agentic RAG implementations with metrics like Hit Rate and MRR.

- **[guardrails](guardrails/)** - Guardrails for AI agents. Learn to make AI agents safer with input and output guardrails to prevent harmful behavior and keep agents on-topic.

### Development Tools & Workflows

- **[vibe-coding](vibe-coding/)** - Introduction to Vibe Coding with AI-assisted development tools including chat applications, coding assistants, IDEs, project bootstrappers, and agents.

- **[dezoomcamp-docker](dezoomcamp-docker/)** - Docker and PostgreSQL data engineering workshop. Learn Docker fundamentals, containerization, data ingestion, and Docker Compose for data engineering workflows.

- **[temporal.io](temporal.io/)** - Workshop materials for Temporal.io workflows and distributed systems.

### Libraries & Tools

- **[agents-lib](agents-lib/)** - Library and utilities for working with AI agents.
